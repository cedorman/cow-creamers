          <h1>Staffordshire</h1>
          <p>I am using this term in a very general and admittedly inappropriate way (although I’m not alone in doing
            so) to refer to my small collection of British earthenware (and a few porcelain) cow creamers dating from
            the 18th and 19th centuries (with a few early 20c).&nbsp; Very recent ones with similar shapes and styles
            are for the most part covered either under the manufacturer (e.g., Kent, which has adopted some of the
            older molds from creamers shown here), or under ‘Places’, or just lumped in with all the other modern
            creamers.</p>

          <p>The main English centre for producing pottery cow creamers, starting around 1740 with saltglazed
            stoneware, was Stoke-on-Trent and vicinity (which is in Staffordshire, thus the general term).
            Stoke-on-Trent is made up of six distinct towns: Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton -
            collectively known as "THE POTTERIES".  See their web site, <a href="http://www.thepotteries.org/">www.thepotteries.org</a>,
            for lots of good basic information on the area, the potteries, potters, etc..  However when cow shaped creamers and spill vases became
            popular, inspired at least a bit by Schuppe’s silver ones, other pottery centers – notably in Tyneside,
            Yorkshire, South Wales and South Scotland -- also began producing them, in part because Staffordshire
            potters moved to these areas to establish or run factories.  I have trouble distinguishing creamers from
            these other centers from those of Staffordshire, unless the seller provides information. One exception is the
            Swansea, South Wales creamers, many of which are quite distinctive.  I have therefore
            included a description of these Welsh potteries and their cow creamers down near the end of this page. I
            have also added a section dealing with Spill Vases, many of which used the cow creamers as part of their
            decoration.</p>

          <p>My collection pales in comparison to the fabulous Keiller Collection in the Stoke-on-Trent Museum Art Gallery, but I do have a number that I’m quite fond of. One problem with these creamers – as
            indeed with any ‘figures’ of the period, be they of people or animals - is that not many of them have a
            well established provenance. Such is the case even with the Keiller collection – I believe that only three
            of the 667  in that collection have the maker’s name impressed.  As opposed to silver creamers, where
            hallmarks and assays are the norm (and generally required by law as well as by the guilds), most of the
            early pottery creamers don’t have marks or any sort, and since they were basically common household items,
            the maker was of little importance to the buyer.  I  will give as much information as I have, but in
            general I have found that the sellers – even ‘Staffordshire’ experts – don’t have much
            information. I welcome any and all help in improving my attributions. One other note is
            that most of these creamers have restorations of some sort, although in most cases they have been carefully
            done by professionals and are hard to discern. The need for restoration isn’t surprising, since the
            horns, tails and ears are quite fragile (except for when they were cleverly smushed down onto the cow’s
            head or body), and these were made for daily use more than for display.</p>

          <p>Cow creamers were, of course, only a very small component of the wares produced in Staffordshire, which
            had been noted for its potteries for hundreds of years. Most pieces naturally were simply utilitarian –
            bowls, pots, plates, etc.  Starting in the 1700s, in keeping with the overall trends of industrialization
            in Britain, the potteries became more mechanized and organized, and so they remain today although there
            has been an almost infinite number of changes in process as well as ownership and organization of the
            firms.   There are a number of good sources for the potteries history, but for a short version I’d
            suggest   <a href="http://www.historynet.com/potteries-of-staffordshire.html">http://www.historynet.com/potteries-of-staffordshire.htm</a>
            .  At around the middle of the 18th century, in response to a growing demand for both quality and
            decoration, the potters began to complement their functional items with figures of people and animals. Not
            unnaturally some of these more fanciful items also were designed to serve useful purposes such as holding
            spills, and – after they became popular – serving milk and cream.   For a brief introduction to the art of
            the very popular (and still very highly sought by collectors) Staffordshire figure, try <a href="http://www.adelekenny.com/-staffordshire-figures.html">http://www.adelekenny.com/-staffordshire-figures.html</a>.
            For those who want a more in-depth treatment, I can heartily recommend Pat Halfpenny’s excellent book,
           "English Earthenware Figures, 1740-1840", published by the Antique Collector’s Club and available
            through a number of used book sellers both in the UK and the US. </p>
			
          <p>As a side note, as well as a reminder to myself next time I go trolling for cows through the English
            countryside, there’s a web site that provides frequently updated information on traffic on motorways and
            common A/B roads:  <a href="http://www.frixo.com/">www.frixo.com</a></p>

          <p>One more note – I use blue-tack (poster putty) to hold the lids on.  I first encountered it in London in
            1995, where it was used to hold up the pictures of call-girls in the phone booths. It seems to hold quite
            well for several years without hardening or leaving a mark, which is presumably what endeared it to the
            pimps and made the practice tolerable to the police and phone company (albeit in more recent trips the
            practice seems, sadly, to have faded).  It shows in many of the pictures.  If anyone has any better
            suggestions, I’d appreciate it.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This is my favorite – a very lovely model of a cow and calf with boscage or bocage…a term for leafy
                  decoration on pottery of this era; I have seen this style referred to as “Walton School”,after John
                  Walton. I bought this creamer from the London store of Oliver-Sutton antiques in Kensington (they have sincvece closed), who
                  attributed it to Tittensor, circa 1780. Tittensor is both a family name, and the name of a village in
                  Stafford, between Newcastle-under-Lyme and Stone. Although information is sparse, it’s most likely
                  that this creamer can be attributed to Charles Tittensor, who was a small scale potter who
                  specialized in bocage and other earthenware figures, working in Shelton in the early 19c, and who had
                  a number of different partners over the years. The date I was given by Oliver-Sutton is almost
                  certainly incorrect both because (as noted by Pat Halfpenny) Charles Tittensor was not recorded as a
                  potter until after the turn of the century, and because bocage was not introduced until around
                  1810-1815. Given the uncertainties, I’d simply say that this lovely underglaze painted piece is from
                  the first quarter of the 19c.</p>

                <p>Here is another favorite, a purple splash luster creamer in perfect condition that I acquired in
                  early 2013 from John Howard of Woodstock, an Antique English Pottery Specialist, just as he was
                  shipping it to New York for a ceramics show.   Unlike the Tittensor one above, however, the maker is
                  unknown – John could only tell me that he acquired it in Burton on Trent, and that it was
                  manufactured in Staffordshire around 1820.  He did note however that this is a very rare example, and
                  in his four decades in the business it is one of the few that he has seen with no restorations or
                  damage.  At the time it was made, luster ware was at or near the top of the market for earthenware
                  figures, so I can only imagine that the original owner either bought it more for decoration than
                  utility (like the Tittensor piece that would be too unwieldy for daily use), or at least used it on
                  only special occasions. Certainly most of my others have not fared nearly so well as this beautiful
                  cow.</p>

                <p>I purchased this early green and white cow creamerfrom Oliver-Sutton in LKondon at the same time as
                  I acquired the Tittensor. It was identified by them as a Whieldon, circa 1780, and bears an old
                  inventory #509 from the C.B.Kidd collection.  Thomas Whieldon (1719-95)  of Fenton Low,
                  Stoke-on-Trent, was a Master Potter who – according to the Famous Potters page from that town
                  (www.thepotteries.org/potters) taught both Josiah Spode and Ralph Wood, and from 1754-1759 was in
                  partnership with Josiah Wedgewood. There is more information about him a couple sections down. This
                  creamer has a ‘mushroom’ handle on its lid, which like some other very early ones, has simply been
                  cut out of the back of the cow rather than being a separately fashioned plug.ood.  </p>

                <p>I have spent some time on the web trying to find out more about the C.B.Kidd collection, since not
                  only do I have some pieces from it, but they seem to have been offered (at high prices) by quite a
                  number of knowledgeable antique dealers over the years. Courtesy of Robert Walker of Polka Dot
                  Antiques I have learned that Captain Charles Bernard Kidd was born in 1880 in Dartford, Kent, and
                  educated ‘privately’ and at Cambridge. He was a keen hunter of hounds and was Master of Foxhounds of
                  the Southdown Hunt from 1910-1913, which post he relinquished when he accepted a commission at the
                  beginning of WWI. He was a well known collector in the early 20c, and his collection was likely sold
                  by Sotheby’s in the 1950s.</p>

                <p>This finely potted  creamer with milkmaid was ascribed by the knowledgeable seller, Andrew Crowley
                  of Liverpool,  to Thomas Whieldon, circa 1760, and acquired by him from the  “wife of a construction
                  baron (recently deceased) from her Georgian townhouse in the Chelsea area of central London. The
                  pottery pieces were mostly Whieldon and yorkshire Creamwares, with the collection there was an
                  inventory book, which indicated that this creamer was purchased in 1972 from an antique shop on the
                  nearby Kensington church street.”…which just happens to be the location of Oliver-Sutton’s shop.
                    His description notes “the cream coloured earthenware body covered in coloured glazes derived from
                  manganese, copper, cobalt, iron and antimony.  The colours were sponged onto the body and then
                  covered with a clear lead glaze, the subsequent firing caused an intermingling of the colours, this
                  type of ware is also called Tortoiseshell ware.”  This jibes well with what I have recently
                  read about Whieldon in Pat Halfpenny’s excellent book, "English Earthenware Figures,
                  1740-1840"..  This early creamer does have a bit of damage – a chip to its lid and one to the
                  left ear showing the creamware of the figure, and some nicely done restoration to horn tips and the
                  milkmaid’s right arm.  Overall it’s a lovely early example. </p>

			  <blockquote>
                <p>It’s appropriate here to say a bit more about Thomas Whieldon, who is probably the most well-known
                  Staffordshire potter of the mid 18c, and about the early evolution of Staffordshire figures such as
                  my cows. Most of this has been extracted from Pat Halfpenny’s book referenced above, and an article
                  on Pearlware by Terrence Lockett found on the potteries web site.</p>
				  
                 <p> Whieldon was baptized in Stoke-upon-Trent in 1719, and was an established potter at least by the
                  mid 1740s – in works that he first rented and then purchased in Little Fenton.  By 1750 he also had
                  acquired pot works in Fenton Low – some half mile away – which he rented to others. Whieldon remained
                  in business until around 1780, at which time he razed his factory and converted the land into
                  ‘pleasure grounds’ around the home of himself and his (by then) third wife.  Whieldon, like most of
                  the other 150 or so Staffordshire potters of the period, produced tableware as well as the figures. 
                  He made saltglazed stonewares as well as the tortoiseshell and enameled creamware.  The term
                  creamware, for which he seems to be best known, denotes cream colored eartenware.  The figures like
                  my cows were fashioned with a combination of hand and press moulding, dried and then assembled using
                  slip, then biscuit fired.  The piece was colored with metal oxides – manganese brown, copper green,
                  iron yellow or cobalt blue – then covered with a liquid lead glazing and ‘glost’ fired. This process
                  allowed only a limited range of colors due to the high  temperature required to fire the glaze. 
                  Equally important for the increasingly sophisticated buyers of the latter part of the 18c, it
                  produced a product that was not as ‘white’ as fashionable Oriental porcelains.  To respond to this
                  market, Staffordshire potters in the 1770s developed what they referred to as ‘China Glaze’ –
                  basically simply substituting cobalt oxide for iron oxide in the glaze, which produces a whiter ware
                  with a light bluish tint.  Josiah Wedgewood independently came up with a similar process – adding
                  whiter clay and employing cobalt in the glaze to give it a bluish cast.  Wedgewood termed his ware
                  ‘Pearl White’, and today the term for the two similar products is ‘pearlware’.  Whieldon,
                  incidentally, was out of the game by this time.</p>
				  
				  <p>  Although the typical approach for English-made
                  ‘white’ tableware with an oriental touch was to paint underglaze in blue and then apply the china
                  white or pearl white glaze, early ‘pearlware’ figures took advantage of the new approach by tinting
                  the glaze with other metal oxides – copper for green, iron for yellow, manganese for brown or purple,
                  and more cobalt for darker blue - and then individually handpainting them on the figure.  Pat
                  Halfpenny distinguishes these figures of the last quarter of the 18c as ‘coloured glazed’.  The next
                  evolution involved painting or sponging with the same metal-oxide based colors on the biscuit-fired
                  white clay figure, then dipping it in liquid pearlware glaze and firing to seal the colors, more or
                  less as was done with creamware.  Relief-moulded pieces including figures (and cows) that used this
                  technique from around 1780-1840 are referred to by Pat Halfpenny as underglaze painted, although they
                  are also known as  Prattware.   Other under-glaze techniques include ‘spatterware’  and ‘spongeware’,
                  as well as transfer printed wares to include the ‘Willlow’-type patterns in imitation of fashionable
                  Chinese ware (after ~1820 clear glazes began to replace the pearlware glazes on these).  A yet
                  further late 18c embellishment involved on-glaze decorating a pearlware glazed piece. Tese were
                  termed ‘enameled’ by the potters.  This process allowed for a greater range of colors, but was more
                  expensive because it required at least three firings – biscuit, glaze or glost, and then one or more
                  to ‘burn’ the colors (and maybe even more for effects such as lustre or gilding, and even over-glaze
                  printing, used especially for commemorative jugs and mugs).  A good many of my colorful early 19c and
                  later creamers are of this ‘enameled’ or enamel painted type. </p></blockquote>

                <p>This selection of three creamers is a good place to say a bit more about styles of early English
                  creamers (and other figures).  All three here are multi-colored underglazed pottery – the one in the
                  middle, like the one with green coloring above, has an incised lid, and came from the Kidd collection
                  via Oliver-Sutton shop which called it ‘Whieldon-type’.  From its coloration it could be termed
                  Creamware.  I believe it’s quite early, say mid 1780s, from before folks started making round holes
                  in the top and fashioning separate plugs.  The two surrounding it are whiter in color, thus pearlware
                  (see feature articles at <a href="http://www.thepotteries.org/">www.thepotteries.org</a> for some
                  good information if you can’t find a copy of Pat Halfpenny’s book); presumably  the clay in the body
                  is whiter (no breaks on these so can’t be sure), and the glaze is tinted with cobalt=oxide.  They are
                  also 18c, sold to me (at London antique fairs) as being from around 1790. </p>
				  
				  <p>All three of these cow creamers could be termed
                  ‘Pratt Ware’ or ‘Prattware’, which as noted above became the generic term for underglaze colored
                  cream and pearlware that was made rather widely in the UK from about 1785 to 1840.  The best
                  information source on these that I have found is “Pratt Ware – English and Scottish relief decorated
                  and underglazed colored earthenware 1780-1840” by John and Griselda Lewis. From there we learn that
                  there was a Pratt family of potters “who were working at Lane Delph in the late eighteenth century
                  and also at Felton after 1807”.   The term Pratt Ware however wasn’t used until the early 20c, 
                  when a couple of rival authors coined it based on a very few multicolored underglazed jugs with
                  relief decorations that bore the Pratt name and were in the prototypical style.  So the Pratts have
                  been memorialized rather by happenstance, with their name applied to wares made by hundreds of
                  potteries over a span of decades.  The Lewis’ book has hundreds of pictures as well as fascinating
                  articles about the Pratts, how the wares were made and colored, and the many locations where this
                  style of decoration was employed until it was surpassed by overglaze enamel colored wares and other
                  techniques that became popular in the early to mid 19c.</p>

                  left was probably from Yorkshire, 1780-1800.  The middle one is from around the same date, but looks
                  to be Prattware; and the one on the right was described as Pearlware from @1830 (pearlware seems to
                  be a somewhat ambiguous and general term relating to coloring and glaze, see the reference above). 
                  These three have interesting different representations of milkmaids; some potters seem not to bother
                  with arms, others like to include facial features. </p></blockquote>

                <p>This is a lovely example of a similar form – said to date from the 2nd quarter of the 19c – with a
                  Rockingham glaze of the ‘flint enamel’ type – characterized by the touches of bright color fused in
                  the glaze - on yellowware. There’s a bit about this type of glaze in the Bennington section because
                  it was very popular on American pottery (and the American versions are reputed to be superior to the
                  British ones). A bit of additional information is that this mottled brown glaze has its origins at
                  the Swinton factory on the Marques of Rockingham’s estate near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. The
                  Wikipedia article on Rockingham pottery notes that “After the closure of the works in 1842, some of
                  the craftsmen remained on site to continue manufacturing on their own. The most successful of these
                  was the Baguley family, the most senior of whom Isaac Baguley had been the manager of the gilding
                  department at the factory. Baguley decorated porcelain that was bought in as unglazed biscuitware
                  from other potteries. The classic brown Rockingham glaze was used, the rights to which Baguley had
                  acquired after the closure of the pottery, with much use of gilding and occasional enameling.
                  Baguley eventually moved to nearby Mexborough and the family continued decorating bought-in porcelain
                  there until the end of the 19th century.” </p><br>

                <p>Here are three versions of old English ceramic cow creamers that are really quite different in style and make-up
                  from those above, and must have been designed to be more utilitarian than beautiful.  They were
                  probably also quite inexpensive when first sold (unfortunately not now).  The two that are similar
                  both have some damage to the horns – I have yet to find one from this mold that hasn’t suffered in some way or
                  another.  I have no further information about them except that the one with the white base and bark
                  brown spots was said by the seller to date from the 1830s.  I would guess that they’re all pre-(or
                  very early) Victorian, since items from that era tended to be significantly fancier.</p>

                  tinted glaze, most noticeable on the udder. It’s fairly crudely made and has a number of firing
                  cracks. The horns have been replaced, and one of them was then broken at the tip.  Nonetheless a very interesting example, and certainly quite early. </p>

                  typical of much earlier creamers.  It has crazing all over which is not normal for early English earthenware.  The
                  seller, who bought it in the 1980s at a Harrogate antique fair, said she thought it had a base at one
                  time but I see no indication of that. It’s possible that it is a 20c ‘reproduction’, but at least it
                  was reasonably inexpensive, displays very nicely, and is different from my other creamers of this
                  general type. </p>

			<p> Next come a whole bunch of an extremely popular form of Staffordshire cow creamer, still (or at least until quite recently) being produced. I have chosen to dub them "Kent" style after one of the many factories that made them, as discussed on the Favorite Brands page.  This is a modern one, which we bought at The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent when we visited around 1996 to view the famous Keiller collection.  Kent stopped making these in 1962, but the museum had some reproduced (with the Kent knot logo) in a variety of colors for sale in their gift shop. I opted for the green one, although as shown a bit below we did find one iu more traditional brown and white colors while wandering around the  town.</p>

                  stamp that I believe says Wade, England (blurry, and the rest is obscured).  Wade was established in
                  1810 in Burslem, the town that’s the headquarters of the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, and is
                  best known these days for a small solid ceramic animal collectors set called ‘Whimsies’ that came out
                  in 1953.  Their website (<a href="http://www.wade.co.uk/">www.wade.co.uk</a>) didn’t return anything
                  for a search on cow creamer, so I don’t know if these are really from them, but again this is a very
                  popular mold, and has been made by a number of potteries in the area. Again see, e.g., Kent on the
                  ‘Favorite Brands’  page.  The creamer with the reddish markings between the two purple ones has
                  “England” in script on its belly; and for comparison I’ve included a modern one manufactured by the
                  Kent factory between 1944 and 1962; it bears the William Kent logo of a knot with W and K in the
                  loops, “Staffordshire Ware” above and “England” below, and the initials of the artist who decorated
                  it.  The other two pictures show more examples, including one with a blue-willow transfer, a rather
                  crude one in the middle of the second picture, and another Kent model, the cow with bouquets of blue
                  flowers on flanks and forehead and the raised flower on the base, which is also typical of a large
                  number of creamers.</p>

			<p> We bought these two in England when we lived in London in the mid-90s,  fairly early in the period of upgrading  the collection from just a few costing less than $10 each, to being much more includive and learning a bit about those that were made in England. The one on the left came from an antique shop in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, when we visited to see the Keiller sollection in the museum there. The other was purchased about a year earlier, in the famous Bermondsey Market, and was probably the first of my 'Kent' cow creamers. That market had a reputation of being a good place to look for British antiques, but over time I have learned that the prices there weren't any bargain. Both of these cow creamers have the Kent knot logo with "Staffordshire Ware" above and "Kent, Made in England" below. My guess would be that they date from shortly after WWII.</p></td>

They both do have interesting glaze and are slightly rough to the feel. The small flowers and leaves are extremely well painted on both of them, with expected differences . I would guess them to have considerable age.  They each a large blue "L" (or "7" depending on how you look at it) under the base, but per usual no other marks.

                    indicates
                    that there were (at least) two Sandland-related pottery firms that worked in
                    Hanley: "...a firm called Sandland & Colley Limited (Lichfield Pottery)
                    manufactured pottery in Hanley from 1907 - 1910. More prolifically, and much more
                    well known, is the Lancaster & Sandland of Dresden Works, Hanley who manufactured
                    'Sandland Ware' pottery from 1944 until the 1970s." This cow is in very good
                    condition, but could easily date from the early 20c; my guess would be that it's
                    from the Sandland & Colley firm , since most of the "Sandland Ware" pieces I've
                    seen on the web have a very different maker's mark. Perhaps a Sandland collector,
                    or a member of the family, can help me here.

					  <blockquote>
                <p>Here are four examples of creamers with "Blue Willow” pattern transfers.  Blue willow, indeed anything Chinese, was extremely popular since it was first imported
                  in the mid-18c, albeit imports slowed down as British potters learned to copy the style. These  four cow creamers  are said the date from late 19c or early 20c.  They are all from molds similar to creamers
                  I’ve shown elsewhere – long-necked, ‘Kent-like’, or similar to the brownish one with the ‘Majolica’
                  glaze.</p>
					<p>	 The potteries’
                  website notes that “The origins of multicoloured <a href="http://www.thepotteries.org/types/glaze.htm">underglazed</a>
                  printed pottery go back to 1756 when John Sadle<a href="http://www.thepotteries.org/mark/s/sadler.html">r</a>
                  and Guy Green invented the process of <a href="http://www.thepotteries.org/types/transfer_ware.htm">transfer-printed</a>
                  decoration on pottery”, and that “Transfer printing is a process by which a pattern or design is
                  etched onto a copper (or other metal) plate. The plate is then inked and the pattern is
                "transferred" to a special tissue. The inked tissue is then laid onto the already bisque
                  fired ceramic item, glazed, and fired again. Initially patterns were transferred to the ceramic
                  items after glazing, but the ink often wore off, thus "underprinting" was born. Transfer
                  items have a crisp, almost decal look about them. If you look closely you can often see the place
                  where the transfer design ends. Often these are the areas where the pattern doesn't quite match, like
                  wallpaper.”  </p></blockquote>

                  It is basically in the form of the spill vases shown below, but certainly not
                  designed to hold spills so it must have been intended as either a creamer or
                  simply a decorative piece. It’s very finely made and painted, but has no marks and
                  I have no information about its age or maker, although I expect that it is fairly

                <p>This is an earlier and more important porcelain piece, dating from @1865, which I acquired at a
                  London antique fair in 1997 and about which I have at least a bit of information.  The mark on the
                  base shows that it was made by the partnership of Stevenson and Hancock, which began in 1863 and
                  operated in Derby. From the web site www.derbyporcelain.org.uk we learn that  “The Old Crown Derby
                  China Works, or as it is better known these days, the King Street Factory, ran from 1849 until 1935,
                  when it was taken over by the present Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Co. Ltd., and closed down.  It
                  formed an historic link between the earlier Nottingham Road factory and the current works on Osmaston
                  Road, Derby.  On the closure of the Nottingham Road factory in 1848, six workers from there set up a
                  china manufacturing business in rented premises at 26, King Street, Derby.  Of the various
                  proprietors who ran this concern over the years, Stevenson and Hancock are the best known.  Their
                  initials formed part of the main factory mark of a crown over crossed swords and D, with two sets of
                  three dots and the initials S and H, which continued to be used after the deaths of both Stevenson
                  and Hancock, in fact right up to the closure of the factory. The factory produced both decorative
                  ornamental wares as well as useful china and offered a replacement service to customers who had
                  broken pieces that they owned. Shapes and patterns used earlier at Nottingham Road were repeated, as
                  well as turning out entirely original wares. A few products, mainly figures, were made in unglazed
                  biscuit, but the bulk of the output was in glazed white or in enameled form, all of the latter being
                  hand painted.” There’s more history of Derby pottery and S&H at
                  http://richardgardnerantiques.co.uk/page/818/Derby.  I would imagine that porcelain cow creamers were
                  relatively rare, since the creamers were primarily utilitarian items and porcelain was significantly
                  more expensive than earthenware.  Indeed, the books I’ve read indicate that many earthenware figures
                  were modeled after porcelain ones, but intended for a lower priced market.  I find this cow to be a
                  particularly lovely example – the stand or plinth underneath the belly was intended to keep the soft
                  porcelain from drooping during firing.  Unfortunately it is missing its lid that also has the tip of
                  the tail, as shown in the glazed  versions below</p>

                  <p>I believe this large cow with a calf is also quite modern.  It is clearly impressed for “Leedsware
                  Classical Creamware, England”, and there is an interesting story here. From
                  www.worldwideshoppingmall.co.uk’s section on pottery we learn that “Brothers' John and Joshua Green
                  in partnership founded LEEDS POTTERY in Leeds in 1770 with Richard Humble. Success soon came with the
                  production of household goods in a variety of ceramic bodies, the most popular being CREAMWARE, a
                  type of earthenware made by several companies from white Cornish Clay with a translucent glaze,
                  producing the pale cream colour from which it took its name…By 1781 William Hartley had added his
                  design and business expertise to the Green brothers' production skills and under the name Hartley
                  Greens & Co the company flourished, expanding its trade across Europe and into Russia. Such was
                  its success that from then on Creamware would also be known as Leedsware. In the 19th century after
                  the death of its founders the different tastes of the Victorian era brought a gradual decline in
                  business, leading eventually to the Pottery's closure in 1878. Despite the later demolition of the
                  kilns and buildings, surviving moulds and clues from pattern books together with fine examples of
                  Leeds pieces in local museums enabled production of Creamware to the original designs to continue to
                  this day.” In trying to track down the manufacturer of my version I learned (from a kind person at
                  Hartley Greens) that the old Leedsware molds were sold off by the Leeds City Council around 1988 in
                  two lots. One lot was purchased by Hartley Greens (which has a nice history of Leeds Pottery on
                  its web site), and the other by Classic Creamware, which in turn was bought out, although the company
                  that bought them no longer makes creamware. So either my creamer is 18c, which I doubt, or it’s
                  only a couple decades old and the mold for it is still around, somewhere.  Help please, anyone??</p></bl

                  making this rather crude but delightful copy of a early creamer.  One feature is
                  unique - the hind legs are hobbled, presumably to keep her from kicking over the
                  milk pail.  Must have been a very frisky cow.  I have never seen this on an
                  original old English cow creamer, and am thus wondering if the model had this
                  feature or if it was added by the imagination of the potter.  There was a horse
                  figurine by the same potter for sale at the same time, which I didn't purchase. </p> </blockquiote>

                <h2 align="center"><a name="Swansea"></a>Welsh Ceramics and Swansea Potteries</h2>
                <p>This introduction is derived principally from “Welsh Ceramics in Context, Part 1”, edited by
                  Jonathan Gray and published by the Royal Institute of South Wales with support from the City and
                  County of Swansea in 2003, supplemented by several articles from the web.</p>
				  
                <p>Swansea is located on the southwest coast of Wales, in what was then the county of Glamorgan
                  (Glamorgan has been significantly reorganized several times – the potteries discussed here were in
                  what is now the City and County of Swansea*) at the sheltered mouth of the river Tawe. With its
                  navigable river, decent harbor, access to local and overseas markets and abundant local coal, Swansea has
                  been a center of trade since Viking times. With the coming of the industrial revolution it was a
                  logical center for the development of copper smelting, and this began in the Tawe valley near Swansea
                  in 1717. By the end of the 18c eight smelters had been founded within three miles of the town (making
                  a mess downwind), and given the advantages of cheap coal and easy transport by sea, many other
                  industries followed. One copper smelter near the town was established by James Griffith in 1720. When
                  the lease on the ground of this older copper works was surrendered in 1764, it was taken up by
                  William Coles and his partners, to establish a pottery. There had traditionally been a simple
                  earthenware pottery tradition in the area, but this was the first attempt to establish a larger and
                  more ‘modern’ manufactory. </p>
				  
                <p>Industrialization had created a demand by the more wealthy segments of society for fashionable wares
                  and for finer ceramics such as were being imported from China and the continent. Developments in
                  Staffordshire, particularly those by Josiah Wedgewood - both by emulation of technique and by the
                  availability of skilled specialist workers - formed the basis for this Welsh expansion that was
                  designed initially to meet the needs of the local market. It took several years to demolish the old
                  copper works, hire the needed experts, and erect the kilns and other facilities for the new trade,
                  but production began in 1767. By 1771 this pottery had hired a master potter from Staffordshire and
                  was producing both saltglaze and creamware bodies.</p>
				  
                <p>William Coles died in 1778, and the pottery struggled (as did many such industries in that era) 
                  until Coles’ son was joined by George Haynes, who had lived for several years in Philadelphia. In
                  1790 a fresh lease was taken for them in partnership.  Haynes, who had initially come back to England
                  thinking of retirement and likely remunerative investments, soon was deeply involved in what was then
                  named the Cambrian Pottery, and became its manager.  Haynes is credited with considerable upgrading
                  and expansion of the works, as well as attracting a talented engraver, Thomas Rothwell, to produce
                  transfer printed as well as enameled wares.  The pottery benefitted from the reopening of trade with
                  America coupled with Haynes’s Philadelphia contacts, and it thrived in the 1790s.  Swansea continued
                  to profit from developments in Staffordshire, particularly those by Wedgewood; and it is not unlikely
                  that cow creamers, as well as other tea and dinner service items and a widening range of wares, were
                  produced there during this period.</p>
				  
                <p>In 1799 Edward Coles died and the Coles’ assets were assigned to Haynes. In 1801 the American Quaker
                  and merchant William Dillwyn visited Swansea, then returned in June 1802 to make an arrangement to
                  buy part of Haynes’s interest in the pottery on behalf of his son, Lewis Weston Dillwyn. Haynes
                  initially remained as manager, with day to day supervision of the works by Edward Green and the
                  firm’s agent Thomas Belington (who became a partner in 1811).  Lewis Weston Dillwyn was primarily a
                  naturalist and spent most of his time in London, thus being a largely absentee proprietor. This
                  worked well until 1809 at which time relationships between Dillwyn and Haynes deteriorated badly and
                  Haynes departed in 1810.  Haynes had surreptitiously acquired a lease of foundry buildings adjoining
                  the pottery, and established a soap works there. This was an extremely smelly business and had a very
                  adverse impact on Cambrian’s workers and customers; Dillwyn was convinced this was malicious, took
                  legal action and won the case. Haynes then established a rival pottery, the Glamorgan, adjacent to
                  the Cambrian. </p>
				  
                <p>Haynes initially financed as well as managed the new business, then brought in his son in law
                  William Baker, and as well as two other financial partners, Bevans and Irwin.  This accounts for the
                  “BB&I” mark which was used on their wares, which were made largely for domestic use.  There were
                  no effective patent or copywrite laws in those days and many of Haynes’s workers followed him, so
                  the new firm produced  lines of transfer printed and enameled creamware and pearlware that were very
                  similar to those of the Cambrian, albeit with some differences in molds and technique.  Haynes died
                  in 1830 and the Glamorgan languished through the lack of his experience, finally being sold in 1837
                  following the loss of Baker and the bankruptcy of Bevan’s Iron Works.  It was purchased by Lewis
                  Llewellen Dillwyn, Lewis Weston’s son, who had run the Cambrian since 1836. He then sold most of its
                  assets to the man who used them to help establish the ‘South Wales Pottery’ in Llanelly.  Competition
                  from this new venture helped lead to the ultimate demise of the Swansea pottery in 1870.</p>
				  
                <p>The Swansea cow creamers – a very minor part of the business just as in Staffordshire – were all
                  creamware or pearlware, as far as I know.  However there were many attempts in Wales to produce
                  competitive, high quality porcelain – both at the Cambrian under Lewis Weston Dillwyn  from
                  1814-1817, and by the celebrated china painter William Billingsly who had spent many years at the
                  porcelain works in Derby, at Nantgarw as well as with Dillwyn in Swansea.  Although the basic
                  ‘recipe’ for this prized ceramic had been available in England since around 1765, it was exceedingly
                  challenging to produce regularly and at reasonable cost due to kiln losses, and this industry never
                  fully succeeded in Wales albeit the pieces that were produced were of very high quality.</p>
				<blockquote>  
                <p>* From Wikipedia we learn (more than you likely want to know) that “Glamorgan
                  or sometimes Glamorganshire, (Welsh: Morgannwg or Sir Forgannwg) is one of the thirteen historic
                  counties of Wales and a former administrative county of Wales…Glamorgan's terrain has been inhabited
                  by humankind for over 200,000 years…The region originated as an independent petty kingdom named
                  Glywysing, believed to be named after a 5th-century Welsh king called Glywys, who is said to have
                  been descended from a Roman Governor in the region. … The name Morgannwg or Glamorgan ('territory of
                  Morgan') reputedly derives from the 8th-century king Morgan ab Athrwys, otherwise known as "Morgan
                  Mwynfawr" ('great in riches') who united Glywysing with the neighboring kingdoms of Gwent and Ergyng,
                  although some have argued for the similar 10th-century ruler Morgan Hen… By virtue of its location
                  and geography, Morgannwg or Glywysing was the second part of Wales, after Gwent, to fall under the
                  control of the Normans and was frequently the scene of fighting between the Marcher Lords and Welsh
                  princes…The Lordship of Glamorgan was established by Robert Fitzhamon following the defeat of Iestyn
                  ap Gwrgant in the 1080s. The Lordship of Morgannwg was split after it was conquered; the kingdom of
                  Glamorgan had as its caput the town of Cardiff and took in the lands from the River Tawe to the River
                  Rhymney. The Lordship took in four of the Welsh cantrefi, Gorfynydd, Penychen, Senghenydd and
                  Gwynllwg. … The Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 established the County of Glamorgan through the
                  amalgamation of the Lordship of Glamorgan with the lordships of Gower and Kilvey; the area that had
                  previously been the cantref of Gwynllwg was lost to Monmouthshire. With Wales finally incorporated
                  with the English dominions, the administration of justice passed into the hands of the crown. The
                  Lordship became a shire and was awarded its first Parliamentary representative with the creation of
                  the Glamorganshire constituency in 1536… From the mid-18th century onwards, Glamorgan's uplands
                  underwent large-scale industrialization and several coastal towns, in particular Swansea and later
                  Cardiff, became significant ports… Under the Local Government Act 1972, the county boroughs and
                  administrative county of Glamorgan were abolished on 1 April 1974, with three new counties being
                  established, each containing a former county borough – West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan, and South
                  Glamorgan. It 1996 these areas were reorganized into several unitary authorities by the Local
                  Government Act of 1994 (an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which amended the Local
                  Government Act 1972 to create the current local government structure in Wales of 22 unitary authority
                  areas, referred to as principal areas in the Act, and abolished the previous two-tier structure of
                  counties and districts.) It came into effect on 1 April 1996… Since 2013, Glamorgan has had its own
                  official flag, red with three white chevrons.” Glamorgan is now referred to as a historical county,
                  and West, Mid and South Glamorgan are preserved counties “for the limited functions of Lieutenancy
                  and High Shrievalty”.<p></blockquote>

                <p>This is a modern (but made with traditional hand-crafted techniques) reproduction of a Swansea,
                  Cambrian cow creamer from the early 19c.  It serves here as a good example of this factory’s cow
                  creamer molds, as well as their typical red and blue enamel coloration. I have learned quite a
                  bit about this handsome reproduction creamer from a very kind collector who inherited one from her
                  mother (who in turn received it from the managing Director of Beefeater UK Ltd who obtained it
                  as a gift in 1988).  Mine is #106 of the 200 produced by the Gladstone Pottery Museum, which is
                  located in Longton, stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire and is a working museum of a medium-sized coal fired pottery, typical of those which proliferated in the area starting in the 18c*.  These limited
                  edition creamers were commissioned in 1987 by Express Foods Group, Ltd to commemorate the opening of
                  a new ultra modern cheese packing factory in Oswestry which was opened by HRH the Duchess of Kent. My
                  cow-respondent noted that Empress Foods “appear to have been acquired by Diageo CL3 Ltd in January
                  2011 who then changed their name to Diageo CV Ltd and are now based in Park Royal, Greater London. It
                  isn't clear whether they still manufacturer food based products.” A web search turned up the
                  information that “Diageo is a global leader in beverage alcohol with an outstanding collection of
                  brands across spirits, beer and wine categories. These brands include Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal,
                  JεB, Buchanan’s and Windsor whiskies, Smirnoff, Cîroc and Ketel One vodkas, Captain Morgan, Baileys,
                  Don Julio, Tanqueray and Guinness.”   I will admit to having sampled a number or their products…but I
                  wonder what they did with the cheese factory.</p>
				  <blockquote>
				  <p>* From Wikipedia we learn that "A pottery factory first opened on the site in 1787. It was run by the Shelley family who produced earthenware and decorated plates and dishes produced by Josiah Wedgwood in Etruria. The site was purchased in 1789 by William Ward who split it into two pot banks: the Park Place Works subsequently named the Roslyn works, and the Wards Pot Bank which was sold to John Hendley Sheridan in 1818.In the 1850s Sheridan had rented out the site to Thomas Cooper who employed 41 adults and 26 children to produce china and parian figures. By 1876 the Wards site had passed into the hands of R Hobson and Co and had been renamed Gladstone, after the politician William Ewart Gladstone. The factory opened as a museum in 1974, the buildings having been saved from demolition in 1970 when the pottery closed (some ten years after its bottle ovens were last fired). In the 1990s ownership passed to Stoke-on-Trent City Council. The museum has shown its commitment to industrial heritage by functioning as a working pottery. However, production has had to be curtailed for financial reasons and the museum is therefore less of a "living" museum than it was. As at 2014 the Middleport Pottery in Burslem, which is used for commercial production, is arguably the only working Victorian pottery in the city of Stoke-on-Trent.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Both Glamorgan and Cambrian potteries produced cow creamers, and given the connection between the
                  two via George Haynes it’s not surprising that they were quite similar.  Here is a good example with
                  which to compare of the differences, as described in the “Welsh Ceramics in Context” book and
                  (although I can’t find the reference recently) the web site of the Swansea museum:  The key feature
                  is the brisket or breastbone, which is pronounced and protrudes downward on the Cambrian cows - here
                  the one to the right – and is more slender on Glamorgan cows.  The Glamorgan ones also had a squarer
                  head.  Another difference is shown here – the Glamorgan cows were commonly transfer printed with a
                  rural fishing scene, and were marked “Opaque China over “BB&I”.  The term, “opaque china” is
                  attributed to Haynes, who coined it for the fine white earthernware from the Swansea potteries. 
                  Apparently most of the Cambrian cows had the red and blue enamel like shown above (more examples
                  follow), or patches of pink luster. Examples of both of these creamers are shown on p.112 of the
                  cited reference, and it notes that the few Cambrian ones that were transfer printed had this design
                  of shells and flowers.  I would imagine that at least the fishing scene, and perhaps the flowery one,
                  were from engravings by Thomas Rothwell. They are nicely applied on both of these cows, and I’m
                  delighted to have these examples in my collection.</p>

                <p>From the coloration, shape of the breastbone, and shape of the base, I’m almost positive this cow
                  came from the Cambrian factory.  The dealer from whom I bought it in Stow-on-Wold in 1997 only said
                  that it was early 19c.  In general, I’m finding that most of the dealers have at least as hard a time
                  as I do, pinning these things down.</p></blockquote"

                <p>There’s bit of a different approach to the coloration here, and slender breastbones…as well as what
                  would appear to me to be the decorator’s mark as well as a small impressed “10” on the base of the
                  cow to the right…I’m guessing This one is Glamorgan, probably a less expensive versions than the
                  transfer printed ones which may account for the lack of a “BBI”. I bought it from a dealer in
                  Cheltenham, who dated it to early 19c but had no knowledge of its provenance.  The one on the left is
                  a bit more problematic – red and blue enamel, a fairly heavy chest, and a base similar to those from
                  Cambrian.  The antique dealer for this one was Jacqueline OOsthuizen of London – supposedly
                  knowledgeable – and they dated it to ~1840.  </p></blockquote>

                <p>This one also came from Jacqueline OOsthuizen’s London shop in 1997 – They said Swansea ~1850, which
                  would put it for sure from the Cambrian works, after the closure of Glamorgan.  It and the few that follow
                  below are very differ from those from the earlier molds – not surprising that tastes would have changed over
                  30-40 years.  This one is missing its base – although it has touches of green on some of the hooves, to me
                  a pretty clear indication that it once had one. I was fairly early in my collecting in those days, however,
                  and didn’t notice that till much later. I probably still would have bought it as a nice example of a
                  somewhat later Swansea cow.</p>

                <p><strong>Introduction</strong>. Friction matches like we’re used to today weren’t manufactured – if that’s the right term – in England until
                  around the 1820s.  Even then, for decades they were much too expensive and rare for
                  routine use, so people used or slivers of wood – sometimes specially shaved for the purpose – or more
                  dangerous paper tapers to transfer fire and light lanterns and cigars or pipes.  These fire-starters
                  are called ‘spills’, and because they were needed frequently, folks would keep a bunch of them in a
                  vase that usually sat on the mantle.  In the grand British tradition, utilitarian items like spill
                  vases morphed into fancier wares that were also decorative, especially during the Victorian era,
                  providing yet another market for the inventive Staffordshire (and other) potteries.  Naturally
                  enough, topics that were already popular as Staffordshire figurines – including cows, milkmaids,
                  dogs, horses, etc – became decorations for spill vases.  The pair shown here – small decorative
                  porcelain bisque versions dating from around the 1870s – are not atypical.  While these two which I’m
                  using to introduce this sub-theme do have cows, the cows are solid.  In many cases however, cow
                  creamer molds were modified and pressed into service as the decorations for the spill vases…and
                  indeed, I’d guess that if you weren’t fussy you could use them for either purpose.</p>

                  appears to have crackling under the glaze. It came to me from Swansea in Wales, although I don’t know
                  if the cow was actually made in that area. The seller, with whom I exchanged some pleasant notes

                  the introduction to Welsh Ceramics, simply said it came from the estate of a well known local

                  and from William Kent Staffordshire. For a very interesting introduction to such
                  Staffordshire figures with a bit about Kent,

                <p>Apparently spill vases are still sufficiently popular as ‘collectibles’ that folks
                  have decided to make reproductions.  The orange and white one bears a small ‘Made in
                  China’ sticker, and the one with the boy at the aft end of his cow, while not marked, is
                  clearly very modern. So per usual, buyer beware…especially on eBay where sellers often
                  don’t know what they have.</p>
