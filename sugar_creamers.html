          <h1>Sugar and Creamers</h1>
          <p>The creamers here all could go in the ‘modern variations’ theme, but their sugar partners are sufficiently
            interesting that I believe they’re best shown separately.  As noted elsewhere, there are also a number of
            sugar and creamer sets in the Teapots section. Conversly, several of those shown here have teapots which
            are pictured separately.  There’s no real logic to this, that’s just how the pictures were taken.</p>

                <p>Meet Mabel the Cow.  This pewter set is a 2011 offering from Vagabond House; they also have a
                  matching butter dish if you’re interested.   Vagabond House is in Sierra Madre, CA…their web page’s
                  ‘about’ section states “We manufacture Pewter and Bronze and hammered brass,  Old carved wood and
                  gleaming glass, Candles in polychrome candlesticks, and peasant lamps in floating wicks, Dragons in
                  silk on a Mandarin suit, In a chest that is filled with vagabond-loot.  All of the beautiful useless
                  things That a vagabond’s aimless drifting brings. “   They don’t sell retail, so I got this one from
                  a web store called ‘The Pink Daisy’.   Mabel herself isn’t marked (presumably so as to not mar her
                  hide), but the tray bears this mark, and the little sugar basket  a similar one, but with a horse’s
                  head in a circle instead of the horse and rider.    For those who care, way down on the bottom of
                  page 3 of Modern Variations there are a few other pewter and other metal cow creamers, including a
                  little furry sitting up one by Vagabond House.  Mabel however is the only one I’ve found that’s part
                  of a whole set.  </p>

                  Stylized though these may be, they are also very American.  They are handmade stoneware from the
                  Bennington Potteries of Vermont, and date to @ the 1960s.  From their web site we learn that
                  Bennington Potteries was founded in 1948 by a young potter named David Gill.  Although pottery had
                  been a major industry in the area since the late 1700s (see the Bennington theme…), it had started to
                  die out around the time of WWI, and was nearly defunct by the time David Gill started his pottery. 
                  With the increased interest in handicrafts in the 60’s and 70’s it grew considerably, and is now a
                  tourist destination as well as a thriving business.</p>

                <p>This is as wild-looking a set as I’ve seen in a long time.  It arrived (via eBay) just before
                  Christmas, so the creamer had a good time watching the ornaments on my office tree until it got
                  shelved in early January.  These whimsical cows are hand-fashioned of heavy ceramic by Jan Newlee

                  originally started as Lipper &amp; Mann in 1946 as an importer of European glass and
                  ceramics. Mr Lipper bought out Mr Mann and changed the name in 1963. He has passed
                  on but the company is still going strong, run by his progeny. I believe that this set dates
                  from the 1950’s, when ‘pixiware’, popularized by Holt-Howard, was all the rage.</p>

                  the present owner, we continue to be conceptual innovators in the popular souvenir range of such
                  items as key-rings, ceramic and porcelain articles, caps, T-Shirts, <SPAN id="lw_1234746246_11">soft
                    toys</SPAN> and magnets. Maintaining that trend-setting position in the competitive world of
                  souvenirs demands high standards of quality control and the best in customer service, which includes
                  customising articles to your specific requirements.”  I of course checked their catalog, and although
                  there are a whole bunch of cow-like thingies, at the moment at least there aren’t any creamers.</p>

                  person would go around collecting mermaids??) we learn that “An importer of dinnerware and glassware,
                  Ucagco (United China and Glass Company) was founded in 1850 by Abe Mayer and originally called Abe
                  Mayer &amp; Co. They had offices in New York and New Orleans and did business throughout the
                  Southeast U.S. as well as Central and South America. It wasn't until the 30s that the company took on
                  the official trademark of UCAGCO and began expanding overseas. In fact, after the war, the company's
                  agent in Japan, S.A. Stolaroff signed the very first contract allowing imports from Japan. A talented
                  ceramic designer himself, Stolaroff worked alongside many Japanese potteries to lead the company's
                  line of ceramics. In 1956, UCAGCO was sold to Sammons Enterprises and in 1962, Stolaroff, who had
                  become the company's president, retired.”</p>

                  her calf.  No markings, but I remember seeing one similar to it in a closed store in Spain.  I’ve
                  seen a couple of these cows, but this is the only one I’ve come across that has the cart as well (and
                  it was correspondingly quite dear on eBay!)</p>

                  sticker for Russ Berrie and Company, Inc.  As the excessively-observant surfer of these pages may
                  note, I also (mistakenly but only tentatively) included the cowboy as a small teapot, albeit this
                  pair is most likely intended to be a set with the larger, guitar playing cowboy teapot. The third
                  pair, in purple dresses with the ears sticking straight out to the side, is unmarked</p>

                <p>I got the first of these gift packages in 1998, from a company called Houston Foods.  In 2002 I got
                  another set from Houston Harvest, Inc. (‘HH’). A bit of browsing indicates that “HH was formed in
                  1997 through the merger of Houston Foods, a TCW portfolio company, and Golden Harvest, a Merit
                  portfolio company”, and was a leading distributor of food gifts and popcorn tins, supplying to mass
                  retailers.  Further googling notes that Milestone Capital Partners purchased HH in November 1996, in
                  conjunction with the management team that also invested.  Wow, who would have guessed there was that
                  much M&amp;A action in the cow candy and popcorn tin business!  Must be makin’ $$!</p>

                  black glaze if hard and shiny, the other colors – blue eyes, gold horns, bell, and hooves, and pink
                  nostrils and inside ears, is ‘cold paint’ added over the glaze.&nbsp; Whoever had these – now
                  probably well over 70 years old – certainly took good care of them because that paint is very easy to
                  rub off.</p>
