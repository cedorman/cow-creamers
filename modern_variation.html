          <h1>Modern Variations</h1>
          <p align="left">There are a lot of these: 500+ pictures, of over 1000 cows. I’ve grouped many of them but
            have left a few as individuals either because they’re special, or to demonstrate ‘class’ characteristics;
            or just because they got left out of the group photo or were purchased after it was taken. I’ve also tried
            to order them a bit, starting by color – white, black &amp; white, brown, purple, blue – and then by other
            features, ending up with some interesting ones from around the world, and finishing with ‘Cow Parade’.
            You’ll also note that while most of these are 20th century (or even a few from the 21st century), there a
            few scattered older ones that didn’t seem to fit well elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Let’s start with a repeat showing of the ones that started it all – my first cow, and my dad’s; and
                  per Bessie and her calves, what happens when you put a bunch of these animals together.  My father’s
                  little blue creamer is German porcelain with a Delft design, and dates from @ the 1910s. Bessie comes
                  from the late ‘40s or early 50’s, and has been identified by sellers variously as “made by American
                  Pottery for Disney by Shaw”, or as one of the animal figurines of Robert Simmons of California.  I
                  favor the latter interpretation. </p>

                  wood fired pottery by Ingrid Barnes.  Her husband and I were college classmates and
                  fraternity brothers way back when, and I have been pestering Ingrid for decades to
                  make me a cow creamer.  She finally came through (after I made her a Nantucket
                  Lightship berry basket, nothing like a bribe for motivation).  I find the coloration
                  on these fascinating - except for the blue spots and edging, Ingrid assures me it's
                  a 'gift of the kiln gods', attributable solely to the firing process.</p>

                <p>This extremely interesting creamer, a hunter in a cow suit, deserves to be up front in pride of
                  place, if for no other reasons than its uniqueness and the quality of the workmanship. It is German
                  porcelain, likely early 20c, and I’d guess almost certainly from near Rudolstadt,  a town in the
                  German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany" title="States of Germany">Bundesland</a>
                  of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringia" title="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, close to the <a

                  of many porcelain factories.  This is the town of the Schafer &amp; Vater Porcelain factory – see
                  Favorite Brands for my collection of their marvelous animal creamers – and their success seemingly
                  inspired many other porcelain factoriues in the area to create similar whimsical items (or
                  vice-versa?).  While I would like to believe that this is “S&amp;V”, I sincerely doubt that it is one
                  of theirs based on the paint and material, but it is certainly characteristic of the  area (as is a
                  chicken that I mistakenly bought thinking it might be S&amp;V).</p>

                <p>These beautiful, hand-molded green cows are a mystery to me.  The smaller one arrived from Canada,
                  and the larger (which is missing her right ear) was part of a fine small collection of a lady from
                  New Jersey.  They are very well made and although they have their horns curled against their
                  foreheads like some of the Victorian era Staffordshire creamers, I would guess that they are American
                  or Canadian, and very likely late 19c.  They’re sufficiently different and interesting that I felt
                  they should be highlighted up near the front of this part of the collection, and I would be delighted
                  if someone could shed more light on their origin and provenance. </p>

                <p>To put at least a modicum of order into the large number of creamers in this category, let’s sort
                  some of them by color - starting with white, if for no other reason than that seemed to be the
                  favorite for ‘new’ cow creamers being offered at the end of the 20c and the start of the 21c (by 2012
                  or so, plain colors started to be more in style though white is still popular).  I have learned that
                  Chuck Williams, who founded Williams-Sonoma in 1956 and was known as an innovator,, takes credit for
                  having started the white cow-creamer ‘fad’ in the US.  To quote a 2004 article about him in USA
                  Today, “Williams recalls the 1960s trip to France when he spied the whimsical piece — only it was
                  covered with colored pieces and featured the city's crest on the cow's flank….’I said to someone that
                  if I could only just get it in white, I could probably sell it in the United States,’ he says. ‘Well,
                  they said that was impossible; they were only made as local souvenirs. …Well, I got them in white. We
                  sold thousands right away.’ " –Here’s another quote, from a tag on a white cow creamer found in a
                  Williams-Sonoma store in 2015: "Chuck's Find: William-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams first spotted
                  this whimsical creamer at Apilco's Paris showroom in 1960. Chuck fell for the simple yet charming cow
                  shape, and it became one of the first pieces of Apilco French porcelain that William-Sonoma ever
                  carried."  So, here on the left is an Aplico creamer (marked for them), on the right a recent one
                  marked for Williams-Sonoma. </p>

                  creamer with flowers.  Nor it seems was Chuck terribly worried about exclusivity, because here is a
                  pair from Pier 1 from the identical mold (and likely the same manufacturer) as the W-S one pictured
                  above.</p>

                <p>Chuck Williams was certainly right however about the popularity of white cow creamers…almost every
                  kitchen shop and department store sells some version of the ‘plain white’ cow creamer.  They come in
                  a rather amazing variety of sizes and shapes, and most of the ‘big name’ cooking schools and kitchen
                  suppliers, e.g. Cordon Bleu, have one or more versions. So do many important porcelain manufacturing
                  areas, e.g. Limoges. </p>

                <p> Here are some examples of rather ‘fine’ pure white cow creamers – one of the two on the outside is
                  marked in green for Gerold Porzellan, Bavaria, Made in Western Germany (their post-1949 mark), and
                  has a black and gold crown sticker on its side from “E&amp;R” (for Ebeling and Reuss ) and Western
                  Germany (meaning after E and W Germany  separated in 1949).  It also has “Germany” and the item
                  number “1498” impressed on the lower right side of the belly, as does its mate which is otherwise
                  without any marks.  There is a very fine web site, produced by JoAnn Snow who collects Gerold
                  Porzellan, that gives a lot of information about this company which operated in Tettau, Bavaria,
                  under various names from 1937 – 1997. See <a href="http://www.gerold-porzellan.com/">www.gerold-porzellan.com</a>;
                  it contains a shot of one of these creamers under kitchenware.  Many of my other German cow creamers
                  bear a similar impression of Germany and an item number but are otherwise unmarked; it may be that
                  they are also from this company.  The creamer with the cover in this picture is marked “White Magic,
                  2092A, Holland”, and also has a joined script J and P.  Goebel’s pure white cows, of similar quality,
                  were shown in the Favorite Brands Theme.</p>

                   The one in the middle with big eyelashes is a French lady, sporting on her belly a green fleur de
                  lis with “Veritable Porcelaine de grand feu”.  The heavy little seated one is stamped “WCL”, and is
                  here because it’s an example of a white one that wasn’t always that way.  The little black specks
                  indicate that at one time it had black ‘cold paint’ spots applied over the glaze, that have since
                  washed off.  I have a couple others like that. </p>

                  one facing to the right bears a striking resemblance to some of my Czechoslovakian and Austrian
                  cows.  It’s not unusual to find that a factory will produce plain white glazed versions of their
                  otherwise colored wares. The only strange thing about the little gal on the right is that she has
                  only three teats.  </p>

                <p>Many creamers come from China these days – a number of years ago they took over from Japan as the
                  principle maker of mass production and relatively inexpensive ceramics.  However the Chinese are also
                  capable of producing beautiful high quality pieces, and did so particularly in the days of the
                  emperors.  Here is one example, said to be 19c Qing dynasty.  It has a broken horn and is missing its
                  lid, but is nonetheless a beautifully crafted piece of Blanc de Chine – which (per Wikipedia’s
                  description) is “the traditional European term for a type of white <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_porcelain"

                  <p>Here are a couple international white cow creamers with interesting stories. The little roundish
                    hornless lady with the big handle is marked for SOFAL, Sociedade do Faiancas SA, Portugal. It also
                    has a logo of wine glasses which might indeed be what this cow is intended to dispense, given the
                    Portuguese proclivity for imbibing good wine. They’re located in Alcobaca…and playing around on the
                    web, I found that in 1999 they were funded by the EU’s  Fifth Framework Programme for an
                    exploratory research and development award “to develop a polymer coating and decoration system for
                    high quality ceramics. This will eliminate the need for multiple, high temperature firings and will
                    enhance the variety and quality of decorative effects dramatically.”  Heavens knows whether my cow
                    received such a coating – but I do like the very unique design. The kneeling cow with the big smile
                    came to me from the UK and is stamped for Laura Ashley.  Corporately, Laura is a fashion and home
                    furnishings company owned by Computershare Investor Services plc in Bristol. Their UK web site
                    (there is also a North American one) has a page that tells all about their history, which begins
                    “Laura and Bernard Ashley started printing fabric on their kitchen table in 1953, following a
                    Women’s Institute Exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum on traditional handicrafts…” and it
                    goes on at length from there. So yes, Virginia, there indeed was a Laura Ashley, sort of the Martha
                    Stewart of her day, though over time like with so many other successful ventures, there have been a
                    number of corporate shifts.</p>

                  but she did recount that it came from the estate of Merlewood House in Torquay where it was a kitchen
                  item in the part of the house that was used as a B&B. So, presumably it has been seen and used by

                  It’s also quite popular to embellish the ‘standard’ white kitchen creamer with flowers or other
                  decorations.   Like the plain ones, these come from a number of kitchen and cooking equipment
                  purveyors, e.g. the one on the far left with the little pink flowers is from Pillivuyt of France, and
                  the one with the orange poppy is from “Williams Sonoma Grand Cuisine”, also of France.   In the other

                  Cuernavaca, Mexico; a couple sets from the same mold and maker are discussed in the ‘creamer and
                  sugars’ theme.  The one with butterflies and the raised lip on the back opening is from Limoges,
                  France, while the other two are both from BIA Cordon Bleu, a wholesale company in California that was
                  established in 1952.  These two are both apparently from the same mold, but are marked slightly
                  differently – the one in the middle says BIA Cordon Bleu International, Custom Made in China, while
                  the one on the far right  is marked for BIA Cordon Bleu Porcelaine &amp; Chine, The Freida
                  Collection, and Hand Decorated in the US.  Apparently different retail outlets for the same wholesale
                  product.</p>

                <p>This happy cow with dainty yellow flowers – actually a satire of a creamer because it has no mouth
                  hole – comes from the firm of John Beswick and family. She and her relatives with flowers of
                  different colors are on the Favorite Brands page, but this one came along later and I thought it
                  deserved a place here as well. The Beswick firm was established in 1892 and was noted for high
                  quality figurines, over the years including dogs, cats, farm and wild animals, and later Beatrix
                  Potter and then Disney characters. In 1969 Beswick was sold to Royal Doulton which continued to
                  produce Beswick products until 2002, but with their own backstamp starting in 1989. In 2004 the
                  Beswick name and design rights were sold off to Dartington Crystal, which continues to produce some
                  figurines as well as vases under the Beswick name. This cow, ‘Daisy the Cow Creamer’, model 2792, was
                  made under head designer Graham Tongue during the Doulton era. It was produced from 1983 to1989, and
                  thus bears the Beswick name. The Beswick 2014 Price Guide by Harvey May gives its value as $85-140.
                  Why ‘Daisy’ when the little flowers look more like roses is beyond me – but then this was part of the
                  ‘Farmyard Humor’ collection so perhaps that, as well as the lack of a mouth hole, was intended to be
                  part of the humor.</p>

                  in China.  I can’t fine anything about Gracie China on the web, but Coastline Imports, headquartered

                    the circle usually made by the tail.   I’m afraid I was able to offer the UK seller no real
                    assistance, other than rescuing it from a boot sale.</span></p>

                  Some white creamers also come adorned with delicate raised flowers.  The kneeling cow with the handle
                  is from N. Sorrento by Arnart.  The wonderful gotheborg web site’s page on Japanese marks notes that
                  “Arnart Imports Inc. [which was started in 1952] is still in operation and is currently located in
                  230 Fifth Avenue, New York. The company specializes in Porcelain gifts and decorative accessories.
                  First registrated trade mark is the Crown and A's mark registered April 30, 1953. A mark looking like
                  a bee hive (which adorns this creamer), was first used the last of December 1957. Both were cancelled
                  in 2001”.  The small matte-white cow with the gold bell is simply stamped “L-434” and has a blue and
                  white oval sticker for Made in Japan.</p>

                  cows around the bottom Says “Grevilla Wines, Bega” on its chest, and it marked for Damsel Products of
                  Australia on the bottom. Leave it to the Aussies to pour wine from a cow (or a boot, or …).  Its
                  neighbor bears a sticker from Maxwell &amp; Williams Designer Homewares, an Australian owned company
                  that started in 1995.   In the middle picture, this creamer is sitting next to a smaller cousin, in
                  this case one made by Dansk.  In the third shot, the Dansk creamer is surrounded by one from Spain on

                  James Herriot web page.  There are a couple more Border Fine Arts James Herriot creamers further down
                  in this theme.  The Herriot cow’s companion in this picture, with the stand supporting its belly, is
                  unmarked except for ‘6970’ on the right side of the base, which is hollow and connected through the
                  legs to the body cavity; it came from the UK via eBay, so my assumption is that it is British or
                  European.</p>

                  that “Fairmont &amp; Main Limited was established in 1994 by Philip and Glennis Harrison with a
                  commitment to offering our customers good quality tableware, greater value and excellent service.
                  During the last twenty years we have done just that and in the process established ourselves as a

                  This is a rather simple creamer that may not seem to deserve ‘stand-alone’ notoriety from all the
                  other black and white ones, but what I find interesting is that the writing on the box, and on the
                  inside care instructions, is in German, English, Dutch, and Czech.  He/she (it’s rather sexless…) has
                  a decal on the bottom that says TCM, and it was ‘Made exclusively for: Tchibo GmbH, Überseering 18,
                  Hamburg’, but gives a UK website (it turns out that Tchibo has websites, for on-line shopping, in
                  several European companies).  Checking that out, I find that Tchibo started in 1949 as a mail order
                  coffee company (that may explain why we found this cow in a coffee shop in the railroad station in
                  Potsdam), but is now an international corporation whose product lines include “travel, mobile calling
                  plans, financial services, fashion and technology.” Egad. Amazing what you can learn from a little
                  cow, and equally amazing how companies change.  </p>

                  Now, here’s an interesting interpretation – her legs are so short and splayed she’s standing on her
                  teats. Rubber tipped of course.  Her tag appropriately dubs her “Udderly Cow Creamer”; she was made
                  in China, ©2005 for Boston Warehouse Trading Company.  Their web site, <a href="http://www.bwtc.com/">www.bwtc.com</a>,
                  notes that they were founded by Peter Jenkins of Manchester, England, in 1974, initially distributing
                  European products but creating their own housewares staring in 1980.  If this creamer is any
                  indication, they have weird ideas about cows in Boston. She’s not alone, however…check out her
                  cousins on the ‘Sugar and Creamers’ page.</p>

                  novelties and various ceramic and glass accessories. By 1959, the company distributed ceramic and
                  brass imports from Japan and England. Two decades later, under the operation of president Charles
                  Brinn and vice president David M. Brinn, the company was listed as in importer of ceramic figurines,
                  animals, novelties, dinnerware, stainless steel, and dolls.”  All kinds of ‘stuff’.</p>

                  that “The House of Schwarzburg was one of the oldest noble families of Thuringia, until its
                  extinction in 1971 with the death of Prince Friedrich Günther.. Reigning over the County of
                  Schwarzburg and founded by Sizzo I of Schwarzburg (died 1160), the family split in the 16th century
                  into the lines of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, which were not reunified
                  until 1909.” What that has to do with either cows or witches is beyond me, but for those with an
                  interest, there’s a whole lot of info about the House Laws of Schwarzburg in www.heraldica.org.</p>

                  creamer (it

                  repaired legs, and neither are marked. The dark brown one is from the UK and was said to be ‘rustic
                  Victorian’.  I think that may not be an inapt description since it does seem to be a relatively early
                  version of the simple standing cow creamer that started to come into fashion in England about that
                  time.  </p>

                  tail, so I contected the seller who  - after a friendly  exchange of emails - sent me another direct
                  from Pataling Jaya, Selkangor, Malaysia.   It has a squarish fill hole but no lid, and when I
                  inquired I was told it didn’t have one.  Well, some 7 ½ years later up pops the little guy on the
                  left that’s quite similar albeit made with what I believe to be a different but quite similar mold.
                  It does have a lid, but came to me from a much less exotic place – North Carolina.  </p>

                  first one I bought was sold as ‘Victorian’, which is probably about right, and the one on the right
                  retains faint remnants of the writing in its side, “Straught fra the cou”.  The rest of these are
                  also German – the large brown one has the incised “Germany 1498” on the lower belly, indicating that
                  although it has no makers mark,  it’s a colored version of the Gerold Porzellan white creamer
                  described above (this didn’t occur to me until I was writing this, then I went and closely compared
                  them and yes they are from the same mold, as is a grey and white one shown later on) and the ones in
                  the grass are marked “3865, Germany”.  The one in the middle with the grass base is the #3864 in the
                  same series…sold as a ‘cow creamer’ as many other animals are, this one’s a giraffe.   </p>

                  The larger and smaller ones are unmarked, but the middle one’s belly bears the impressed mark of an
                  oval with “N.J.” inside; it also has the word JERSEY impressed, not just printed, on both sides.  All
                  three came from the UK.  The seller of the middle one attributed it to Mervyn and Nelys Jude, but
                  could offer no further help…a web search places a Nelys Jude in Oswestry, and a Mervyn Jude in
                  Dereham…there may of course be others, or different dates, or… There is beer mug attributed to two
                  folks by those names in the Auckland Museum, but the Kiwis date it to the 18c.  Mervyn Jude is also
                  noted as an English artist, apparently mostly painting horse races like the Grand National, judging
                  from ones sold at auction in the 1970s.  Per usual I’d enjoy hearing more info on this mysterious but
                  talented couple.  They did make a nice cow creamer.</p>

                <p>Meet Peppy the&nbsp;Cow.&nbsp; In some ways Peppy is a very ordinary, if nice,
                  little&nbsp;cow.&nbsp; There’s a white version of her featuring Washington DC in the Advertising
                  section, and I have other creamers like her – although not shown – from Michigan, Virginia, Houston,
                  the Grand Ole Opry, and even Germany.&nbsp; She’s very popular for souvenirs, and appears frequently
                  on eBay.&nbsp; In another way though Peppy is a very special little&nbsp;cow.&nbsp; Oli Fowler, a BA
                  student in Graphic Design at Camberwell College of the Arts in London, picked her up at a charity
                  shop in Walthamstow as part of a university project; the task was to buy and research a&nbsp; charity
                  shop object that caught his eye, render it in drawings, paint, digital, etc, and tell its story past
                  and future.&nbsp; As part of his research Oli came across this web page and that started a fun
                  conversation…Oli probably learned more about&nbsp;cow&nbsp;creamers than he really wanted to
                  know!&nbsp; So naturally enough when he put Peppy up on eBay to let her continue her travels, I had
                  to acquire her.&nbsp; Oli was kind enough to include one of his many excellent drawings along with
                  Peppy…they now form a proud and happy part of my collection. Peppy has indeed gotten around quite a
                  bit, and it’s nice to know a bit of her history.&nbsp; I sure hope Oli got a good grade! </p>

                <p>These lovely little kneeling creamers are marked for Brad Keeler, mold #711.&nbsp; &nbsp;From <a
                    href="http://california-pottery-index.com/">http://california-pottery-index.com</a> we learn that
                  he “was born in Lincoln, where his father was a ceramic engineer for the local Gladding-McBean plant.
                  After studying art at USC Keeler opened his own Glendale studio where he created naturalistic figures
                  of birds and animals. These were air-brush decorated and enhanced with hand-painted details.
                  Especially popular were the flamingo figures. In the mid-forties Keeler developed a brilliant red
                  glaze which he called Ming Dragon Blood. This lead to the development of a successful line of Chinese
                  Modern housewares...vases, ginger jars, low bowls, smoking sets and more. Business was good enough to
                  build a new large factory on Delay Drive in Los Angeles. While Japanese were flooding the market in
                  the early fifties, Keeler was still expanding, building an even larger factory in San Juan Capistrano
                  in 1952. Tragically that same year, Keeler suffered a deadly heart attack. The company couldn't
                  survive the loss and closed its doors in 1953.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The bidding on eBay went quite high for
                  such small creamers, which is an indication that there must be quite a few Brad Keeler fans out
                  there. </p>

                  and from a bit of searching it does seem to resemble their style.  From the Encyclopedia of Arkansas
                  History and Culture (or from Kansapedia of the Kansas Historical Society) we learn that “Dryden
                  Pottery was founded in Kansas by A. James Dryden, who relocated his business to Hot Springs (Garland
                  County) in 1956. Dryden Pottery has become collectible and has been listed in Schroeder’s Antique
                  Guide for many years….” plus a whole lot more.  My wife and I recently visited Hot Springs National
                  Park, and can understand the attraction to a potter – both a good local source of clay and talc, and
                  lots of potential customers from the myriads of folks who came to visit the hot springs. Sort of like
                  the Brits did in the previous century – make nice but reasonably inexpensive things that folks would
                  like for a souvenir of their vacation.</p>

                <p>Here is a lovely, small and fairly modern English lidded creamer, the only one of its type I have
                  seen. It has an impressed mark for “Cheddar Pottery” as well as a triangular sticker with a tower on
                  a hill over script “Carefully made in Somerset England”. It turns out that Cheddar Pottery is a Grade
                  II listed Building  on Cufic Lane, Cheddar, Somerset - “Two cottages, now pottery and shop. Early
                  C19”, according to its listing.  The town has a web site, <a href="http://www.cheddarvillage.org.uk/">www.cheddarvillage.org.uk</a>,
                  that notes that its distinguishing feature is Britain’s largest gorge.  Even more fascinating to me
                  however is the following: “The global origin of the word Cheddar comes from over a thousand years ago
                  when the English village was originally referred to as “che-dwr”,  a combination of English and
                  Gaelic terms which became the “Cheddar” village name we know today. If domain names had existed back
                  then, cheddar.org would have rightly belonged to the village elders (nowadays it’s being
                  cyber-squatted by a domain re-sale agent, but that’s another story)…The cheese made using the process
                  which originated here is the second meaning of the word. And in modern slang the word “cheddar” can
                  also mean&nbsp;money&nbsp;or wealth, and also a way of scoring a goal in football. There is also a
                  mobile productivity “app” called Cheddar, and there is a popular word game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_Gorge_(game)#Cheddar_Gorge">“Cheddar
                    Gorge”</a>.   Quite a nice etymology lesson from this tiny cow. </p>

                  cute smiling cow, unmarked but  decorated with flowers, with its horns and ears melded.<BR>

                  about it, then ordered another when it went on sale.  They also have a plain white one, but I opted
                  for the version with little blue flowers (both times).</p>

                  appear to have much age so I decided to let its blue flowers dictate.  I actually bought it just for
                  the humor of the lid, which is obviously a replacement – someone had a lot of fun adding the rather
                  large and fierce fly. </p>
