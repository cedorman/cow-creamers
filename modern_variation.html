          </p>

          <p>There are a lot of these: 500+ pictures, of over 1000 cow creamers. Thus three pages are needed to contain this part of the  herd. I’ve grouped many of them but
            have left a few as individuals either because they’re special, or to demonstrate ‘class’ characteristics,
            or just because they got left out of the group photo or were purchased after it was taken. I’ve also tried
            to order them a bit, starting by color and then by other
            features, ending up with some interesting ones from around the world, and finishing with the few creamers (and sugars) made as part of ‘Cow Parade’. You’ll also note that while most of these are 20th century (and a few from the 21st century), there
            are a few scattered older ones that didn’t seem to fit well elsewhere.</p>

			<p> On this first page, after a few somewhat special cow creamers that I've put up front, they are ordered by color.  First white ones, then white with some decorations, then black and white, then brown and brown and white, then purple and finally blue. After finishing colors on page 2 there are cows with flowers, a bunch of miscellaneous cows, a number of groups of cows with family resenblances, and then at the bottom of the page the lovely hand-made, Native American Acoma Pueblo Pottery cow creamers.  Page 3 starts off with cows from different countries, then a number of plastic cows, non-silver metal ones, a few 'mistakes', and finally the Cow Parade creamers and sugars.  If you're looking for something you can't find, email me.</p>

                  per Bessie and her calves, what happens when you put a bunch of these animals together.  My father’s
                  little blue creamer is German porcelain with a Delft design, and dates from @ the 1910s. Bessie comes
                  from the late ‘40s or early 50’s, and has been identified by sellers variously as “made by American
                  Pottery for Disney by Shaw”, or as one of the animal figurines of Robert Simmons of California.  I
                  favor the latter interpretation. Both of these creamers are faiuirly common. </p> </blockquote>

                  fraternity brothers way back when, and I had been pestering Ingrid for decades to
                  make me a cow creamer.  She finally came through (after I made her a Nantucket
                  Lightship berry basket, nothing like a bribe for motivation).  I find the coloration
                  on these fascinating. Except for the blue spots and edging, Ingrid assures me it's
                  a 'gift of the kiln gods', attributable solely to the wood firing process.</p></blockquote>

                <p>This extremely interesting creamer, a hunter in a cow suit, deserves to be up front in pride of
                  place, if for no other reasons than its uniqueness and the quality of the workmanship. It is German
                  porcelain, likely early 20c, and I’d guess almost certainly from near Rudolstadt,  a town in the
                  German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany" title="States of Germany">Bundesland</a>

                  of many porcelain factories.  This is the town of the Schafer & Vater Porcelain factory – see
                  Favorite Brands for my collection of their marvelous animal creamers – and their success seemingly
                  inspired many other porcelain factories in the area to create similar whimsical items (or
                  vice-versa?).  While I would like to believe that this is “S&V”, I sincerely doubt that it is one
                  of theirs based on the paint and material, but it is certainly characteristic of the  area (as is a
                  chicken that I bought thinking mistakenly it might be S&V).</p></blockquote>

                  New Jersey.  They are very well made and although they have their horns curled against their
                  foreheads like some of the Victorian era Staffordshire creamers, I would guess that they are American
                  or Canadian, and very likely late 19c.  They’re sufficiently different and interesting that I felt
                  they should be highlighted up near the front of this part of the collection, and I would be delighted

			<p> Here is the last of the 'up front' modern cows, a winsome Exon Wemyss one by Brian Adams. It comes with a story.</p>
			
			<p>Some time ago, a very lovely lying down cow creamer advertised as Wemyss Ware  came up on eBay; I bid too low and lost. So I looked them up and learned from wemyssware.co.uk that “The ‘Wemyss Ware’® name has had a long and distinguished history from its beginning in 1882. It was the brainchild of Robert Heron, the Pottery owner, and Karel Nekola, a gifted decorator whom he had brought over from Bohemia. It is probably the most highly collectable and sought-after Scottish pottery, producing beautifully hand painted pottery cats, pigs, other animals, giftware, decorative tableware, tiles and limited editions, all made in Scotland… For 30 years since 1985 ‘Wemyss Ware’® has been produced by the Griselda Hill Pottery Ltd® in the Fife village of Ceres, ten miles west of St. Andrews. “  I wrote to them and asked is they had a cow creamer available, and they responded quickly that Wemyss had never made one, and it was likely that what I had seen was “Exon Wemyss Ware”.  So of course, I had to investigate that.</p><p>
			
I found the website http://wemysswarebook.com/tag/exon-wemyss/ entitled “A tribute to Brian Adams (1945-2016)” which has a long and quite fascinating  story  that starts by noting that “To those familiar with Wemyss Ware, Brian Adams was well known as the founder of the Exon Art Pottery in Ashcombe, Devon that produced a recreation Wemyss Ware from 1988.” To briefly summarize from that article,  Brian started in government work but loved painting and pottery and by 1982 became a stilled restorer, focused on using original production techniques. The idea of producing a ‘recreation’ Wemyss was initiated by the Prince of Wales in 1987. Brian was induced to take on the project  and then met Esther Weeks, the last Wemyss decorator from their old and original Bovey Pottery (now the Bovey Tracey Pottery Museum, for which Brian was restorer and curator until his death) . Together they developed the Exon Wemyss line of pottery, very like the original. In 1993 Esther moved to the Griselda Hill pottery, but between 1988 and 2005 some 2700 pieces of Exon Wemyss were produced, most decorated by Brian.  In addition to my sweet-faced cabbage rose cow creamer shown here (which has a broken and repaired tail), there are versions with yellow flowers and a fly on top, as well as one with horns…for which I will be searching. </p></td>

                <p>To put at least a modicum of order into the large number of creamers in this category, let’s sort
                  some of them by color - starting with plain white, if for no other reason than that seemed to be the
                  favorite for ‘new’ cow creamers being offered at the end of the 20c and the start of the 21c (by 2012
                  or so, plain colors started to be more in style though white is still popular).  I have learned that
                  Chuck Williams, who founded Williams-Sonoma in 1956 and was known as an innovator, takes credit for
                  having started the white cow-creamer ‘fad’ in the US.  To quote a 2004 article about him in USA
                  Today, “Williams recalls the 1960s trip to France when he spied the whimsical piece — only it was
                  covered with colored pieces and featured the city's crest on the cow's flank….’I said to someone that
                  if I could only just get it in white, I could probably sell it in the United States,’ he says. ‘Well,
                  they said that was impossible; they were only made as local souvenirs. …Well, I got them in white. We
                  sold thousands right away.’" Here’s another quote, from a tag on a white cow creamer found in a
                  Williams-Sonoma store in 2015: "Chuck's Find: William-Sonoma founder Chuck Williams first spotted
                  this whimsical creamer at Apilco's Paris showroom in 1960. Chuck fell for the simple yet charming cow
                  shape, and it became one of the first pieces of Apilco French porcelain that William-Sonoma ever
                  carried."  So, here on the left is an Aplico creamer (marked for them), on the right a recent one
                  marked for Williams-Sonoma. </p>

				<blockquote>
                <p>Chuck Williams was certainly right however about the popularity of  white cow creamers. Almost every
                  kitchen shop and department store sells some version of the ‘plain white’ cow creamer. Most of the cows in these 'herd' shots are unmarked and many of them look alike  with minor variations, but a few deserve a bit of a mention. It the picture on the left, the cow on the far right was made in China for Fox Run, a gift shop in Deep River, CT. Next to it is a cow marked for "Porcelaine de France"; there are a number of these with gold embellishments and transfer pictures on the Advertising and Souvenirs page. In the middle picture, the one in the center front is one of Chuck's Williams-Sonoma Market Place creamers, and on the far right one of the many, often decorated with flowers or birds,  from Cordon Bleu.  In the third picture, on the far back left is a cow creamer from Limoghes, next to a kneeling one from Fitz & Floyd.    </p></blockquote>

                <p> Here are some examples of rather ‘fine’ pure white cow creamers – one of the two on the outside is
                  marked in green for Gerold Porzellan, Bavaria, Made in Western Germany (their post-1949 mark), and
                  has a black and gold crown sticker on its side from “E&R” (for Ebeling and Reuss ) and Western
                  Germany (meaning after E and W Germany  separated in 1949).  It also has “Germany” and the item
                  number “1498” impressed on the lower right side of the belly, as does its mate which is otherwise
                  without any marks.  There is a very fine web site, produced by JoAnn Snow who collects Gerold
                  Porzellan, that gives a lot of information about this company which operated in Tettau, Bavaria,
                  under various names from 1937 – 1997. See <a href="http://www.gerold-porzellan.com/">www.gerold-porzellan.com</a>;
                  it contains a shot of one of these creamers under kitchenware.  Many of my other German cow creamers
                  bear a similar impression of Germany and an item number but are otherwise unmarked; it may be that
                  they are also from this company.  The creamer with the cover in this picture is marked “White Magic,
                  2092A, Holland”, and also has a joined script J and P. Goebel’s pure white cows, of similar quality,
                  were shown in the Favorite Brands Theme, and there are a couple Delft painted and marker version of this White Magoc cow on that page. </p>

                  <p>Here are a couple international white cow creamers with interesting stories. The little roundish
                    hornless lady with the tall thin  handle is marked for SOFAL, Sociedade do Faiancas SA, Portugal. It also
                    has a logo of wine glasses which might indeed be what this cow is intended to dispense, given the
                    Portuguese proclivity for imbibing good wine. They’re located in Alcobaca…and playing around on the
                    web, I found that in 1999 they were funded by the EU’s  Fifth Framework Programme for an
                    exploratory research and development award “to develop a polymer coating and decoration system for
                    high quality ceramics. This will eliminate the need for multiple, high temperature firings and will
                    enhance the variety and quality of decorative effects dramatically.”  Heavens knows whether my cow
                    received such a coating – but I do like the very unique design. The kneeling cow with the big smile
                    came to me from the UK and is stamped for Laura Ashley.  Corporately, Laura is a fashion and home
                    furnishings company owned by Computershare Investor Services plc in Bristol. Their UK web site
                    (there is also a North American one) has a page that tells all about their history, which begins
                    “Laura and Bernard Ashley started printing fabric on their kitchen table in 1953, following a
                    Women’s Institute Exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum on traditional handicrafts…” and it
                    goes on at length from there. So yes, Virginia, there indeed was a Laura Ashley, sort of the Martha
                    Stewart of her day, though over time like with so many other successful ventures, there have been a
                    number of corporate shifts.</p>

                  It’s also quite popular to embellish the ‘standard’ white kitchen creamer with flowers or other
                  decorations.   Like the plain white ones, these come from a number of kitchen and cooking equipment
                  purveyors, e.g. the one on the far left with the little pink flowers is from Pillivuyt of France, and
                  the one with the orange poppy is from “Williams Sonoma Grand Cuisine”, also of France.   In the other

                  Cuernavaca, Mexico; a couple sets from the same mold and maker are discussed in the ‘creamer and
                  sugars’ theme.  The one with butterflies and the raised lip on the back opening is from Limoges,
                  France, while the other two are both from BIA Cordon Bleu, a wholesale company in California that was
                  established in 1952. These two seem to be  from the same mold, but are marked slightly
                  differently – the one in the middle says BIA Cordon Bleu International, Custom Made in China, while
                  the one on the far right  is marked for BIA Cordon Bleu Porcelaine &amp; Chine, The Freida
                  Collection, and Hand Decorated in the US.  Apparently different retail outlets for the same wholesale
                  product. BIA has made umpteen white cow creamers with decorations, and it's simply not of any interest to me to try for a full sweep.</p>

                  Paperproducts Design GmbH, Am Hambuch, Meckenheim (Per their web site "the leading supplier of unique German-printed paper 
				  tableware and beautiful coordinating accessories"); and the two on the right with flower-like patterns
                  all over are from Nordstrom’s department store – they sell cow creamers from this mold in a variety of patterns – and
                  very likely made in China.The one below on the left is entitled "Dog Wood by Heygill"; it's porcelain and made in Japan. 
				  I find its decorations particularly lovely. To its right is a nice porcelain creamer marked for "KPM"
				  under a crown, and signed and dated by by the decorator, "Anna Smith'84:. From realorrepro.com we learn that 
					"The letters KPM can trace their ancestry back to 1763 when they were first used by the Konigliche Porzellan Manufacktur 
					(Royal Porcelain Manufactory) in Meissen. By 1825, the same letters were beginning to be used by the Royal Porcelain Manufactory 
					in Berlin. There have been fakes and look-alike marks almost since the start of original production...The letters KPM probably
					appear in more marks used after 1925 than in marks before 1925. By the 1950s, KPM was used to imply a sense of quality, prestige 
					and age rather than any specific company. Many of the new KPM marks ... also include place names such as Bavaria
					and Germany which do not appear in early marks. Since the original mark was never registered, it is legal today for reproduction 
					wholesalers to continue using the letters KPM on new pieces imported from China, Japan and Indonesia." Is this cow really KPM? 
					Beats me but it's nice and well,painted, also fairly new so I don't have to worry about getting stuck with an old fake.</p>

              <td>
                <p>This happy cow with dainty yellow flowers – actually a satire of a creamer because it has no mouth
                  hole – comes from the firm of John Beswick and family. She (Dausy) and her relatives with flowers of
                  different colors are on the Favorite Brands page, but this one came along later and I thought it
                  deserved a place here as well. The Beswick firm was established in 1892 and was noted for high
                  quality figurines, over the years including dogs, cats, farm and wild animals, and later Beatrix
                  Potter and then Disney characters. In 1969 Beswick was sold to Royal Doulton which continued to
                  produce Beswick products until 2002, but with their own backstamp starting in 1989. In 2004 the
                  Beswick name and design rights were sold off to Dartington Crystal, which continues to produce some
                  figurines as well as vases under the Beswick name. This cow, ‘Daisy the Cow Creamer’, model 2792, was
                  made under head designer Graham Tongue during the Doulton era. It was produced from 1983 to 1989, and
                  thus bears the Beswick name. The Beswick 2014 Price Guide by Harvey May gives its value as $85-140.
                  Why ‘Daisy’ when the little flowers look more like roses is beyond me – but then this was part of the
                  ‘Farmyard Humor’ collection so perhaps that, as well as the lack of a mouth hole, was intended to be
                  part of the humor.</p>

The colonial city center features the 16th-century Palace of Cortés, former home of Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés and now a history museum with murals by Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Just southwest is Cuernavaca Cathedral, in a 1500s walled monastery complex with a mural depicting Mexico’s first saint." Wikipedia adds that it's only a 90 minute drive south of Mexico City and thus provides a welcome respite from the huge city.

                  manufacturer, RPI or Resourceful Products, Inc, of Belmor NJ…although not surprisingly, it was Made
                  in China. Fair enough I guess, since that’s where porcelain was first developed.</p>

                  several European countries).  Checking that out, I find that Tchibo started in 1949 as a mail order
                  coffee company (that may explain why we found this cow in a coffee shop in the railroad station in
                  Potsdam), but is now an international corporation whose product lines include “travel, mobile calling
                  plans, financial services, fashion and technology.” Egad. Amazing what you can learn from a little

Sakura makes consumer dinnerware for sale through department stores, mass merchandisers, and private labels, and was acquired by Oneida Ltd (for $40M! I guess they must make more than cows) in 2000. Poking around on the web, I found there were a lot of companies using the name sakura…not surprising, I’d guess, since it’s the Japanese word for cherry trees and their blossoms (it’s thus also popular in anime and manga).  Warren Kimble is a folk artist from Brandon, VT, and you can learn all about him at his web site.  He draws big bodied cows with little heads. The one on the right used to be black and white like the others, but my son though it might be fun to give me a camoflauged one (albeit my days weariung camy are well past).</p></td>

                  significantly improved after WWII. From a couple of web sites…e.g. headvase museum and auction
                  bytes – we learn that “Founded by Samuel I. Brinn in the early 50's, the Pittsburgh-based company
                  stayed under the management of the Brinn family. In its beginnings, Brinn's was a wholesaler of art
                  ware, dinnerware, figures, garden pottery, jardinières, premiums, teapots, glassware, ovenware,
                  novelties and various ceramic and glass accessories. By 1959, the company distributed ceramic and
                  brass imports from Japan and England. Two decades later, under the operation of president Charles
                  Brinn and vice president David M. Brinn, the company was listed as in importer of ceramic figurines,
                  animals, novelties, dinnerware, stainless steel, and dolls.”  All kinds of ‘stuff’.</p>

                  that “The House of Schwarzburg was one of the oldest noble families of Thuringia, until its
                  extinction in 1971 with the death of Prince Friedrich Günther.. Reigning over the County of
                  Schwarzburg and founded by Sizzo I of Schwarzburg (died 1160), the family split in the 16th century
                  into the lines of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, which were not reunified
                  until 1909.” What that has to do with either cows or witches is beyond me, but for those with an
                  interest, there’s a whole lot of info about the House Laws of Schwarzburg in www.heraldica.org.</p>

			<blockquote>
			<p> Leading off the brown section, here is one of my two cow creamers hand made and decorated by James Christian Seagraves  (1913-1997).
              There is little doubt about when or where it was made since he kindly advertised all that in big raised letters. The person who sold me the other cow creamer I have of his (it's on page 2)  bought it directly from him and  noted that "like Lester Breininger, Thomas Isaac & Russel R Stahl and Ned Foltz, {he] was influenced by traditional 18th century PA 
			Gerrman redware pottery. " I had difficulty finding anything else about him on the web,  but two other mambers of the extended Seagraves family (they run a web site devoted to learning more about the Seagraves clan) kindly provided a bit of information and a copy of his obituary. From these I learned that his work was principally as a machinist for American Procucts and Chemicals in Trexlertown, PA. He was  a locally well respectred 'folk artist' potter mostly known for his sgraffito redware and bird and fish whistles. His obituarty nores that he also made violins while in his late teens and 20s and he was a member of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen.  I have two cow creamers very similar to his (which are inscribed "JCS") by "VAS".  I believe this to be his second wife, Verna Alice (Maerkeffer) Seagraves. </p> <p>While combing the web for information about him I also found a bit about Breiningsville which is in eastern PA on Wickipedia: "Breinigsville was named for George Ludwig
              Breinig (January 31, 1733 – May 12, 1812), a German immigrant who came to America on board the ship Lydia, arriving in
              Philadelphia on October 13, 1749. He originally settled in Weisenberg Township (tax records show he was assessed 9 pounds
              in 1762). On May 10, 1771, Breinig purchased around 100 acres (40 ha) of land and a stone dwelling for 700 pounds from
              Peter and Catherine Trexler (of "Trexlertown") along "the great road leading to Philadelphia" He resided on that land
              until his death...Among his seven children was Peter Breinig, the youngest son, and the founder of Breinigsville, who
              owned a 123-acre (50 ha) farm. He built a tavern in the village and operated it for some years. As in most early towns,
              the tavern served as the center of the community. Today, the tavern is in the location of the Breinigsville Hotel...Throughout
              the 19th century, the economy of Breinigsville was primarily agriculture and mining. A number of large mines existed; the
              mines and later the train tracks were abandoned. In the early 1900s the town was transformed into a mainly agriculture-based
              economy. Toward the late 1970s and 80s due to relatively cheaper land prices and close proximity to New York, a number of
              major distributors and warehouses have relocated to the area...A number of large book publishing companies also operate from
              Breinigsville. Amazon's distribution warehouse is situated in Breinigsville. The town has a number of large vineyards...and
              the town is also the home to a major Samuel Adams brewery."  Busy little place! But nothing in the article about Mr. or Mrs. Seagraves.. </p></blockquote>

It came with a Big tag trhat on the front reads "Red Shed Home & Gifts - rusic-vintage-classic" and on the back notes that it wa distributed by the Tractor Supply Company of Brentwood, TN.  A cow from a tractor company? That sent me to the web where I found that "Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ: TSCO), the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States, has been passionate about serving its unique niche, targeting the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers and allthose who enjoy living the rural lifestyle, for more than 80 years." and  "Red Shed is a brand that celebrates the modern Tractor Supply customer, the lifestyle they have so proudly built and the inviting farmhouse feel they've created at home" OK I guess than makes sense...recreational farmers do like cows, albeit this one had disappeared from its shop when I checked just now.</p></td>

                  from Pataling Jaya, Selkangor, Malaysia.   It has a squarish fill hole but no lid, and when I
                  inquired I was told it didn’t have one.  Well, some 7 ½ years later up pops the little guy on the
                  left that’s quite similar albeit made with what I believe to be a different but quite similar mold.
                  It does have a lid, but came to me from a much less exotic place – North Carolina.  </p>

What tipped me off was when many years later I got a middle sized one marked as a "Present from Symonds Yat" (descrived on the Advertising and Souvenirs page). It's not marked for Germany but that's likely because it was made to be sold in Britain as as a souvenir from the Royal Forest of Dean .</p></blockquote>

                <p>This delightful small creamer also came to me from the UK.  It's unmarked but I’d guess it's 19c and from Germany or elsewhere on the
                  continent from the style and the thickness of the base. It’s a lovely and unusual example of an early  1-person size creamer, and obviously very different from the English creamers in vogue at the time.  It is also shown on the Miniatures page next to a similar but darker version</p>

                <p>There are a bunch of brown and cream ‘Jersey’ cows marked for the island in the Advertising section,
                  but I thought I’d show these three – from very similar molds but distinctly different sizes – here.
                  The larger and smaller ones are unmarked, but the middle one’s belly bears the impressed mark of an
                  oval with “N.J.” inside; it also has the word JERSEY impressed, not just printed, on both sides.  All
                  three came from the UK.  The seller of the middle one attributed it to Mervyn and Nelys Jude, but
                  could offer no further help…a web search places a Nelys Jude in Oswestry, and a Mervyn Jude in
                  Dereham.  There may of course be others, or different dates, or… There is beer mug attributed to two
                  folks by those names in the Auckland Museum, but the Kiwis date it to the 18c.  Mervyn Jude is also
                  noted as an English artist, apparently mostly painting horse races like the Grand National, judging
                  from ones sold at auction in the 1970s.  Per usual I’d enjoy hearing more info on this mysterious but
                  talented couple.  They did make a nice cow creamer.</p>

                <p>Meet Peppy the Cow. In some ways Peppy is a very ordinary, if nice,
                  little cow. There’s a white version of her featuring Washington DC in the Advertising
                  section, and I have other creamers like her – although not shown – from Michigan, Virginia, Houston,
                  the Grand Ole Opry, and even Germany. She’s very popular for souvenirs, and appears frequently
                  on eBay.</p>
					<p>In another way though, Peppy is a very special little cow. Oli Fowler, a BA
                  student in Graphic Design at Camberwell College of the Arts in London, picked her up at a charity
                  shop in Walthamstow as part of a university project; the task was to buy and research a charity
                  shop object that caught his eye, render it in drawings, paint, digital, etc, and tell its story past
                  and future. As part of his research Oli came across this web page and that started a fun
                  conversation. Oli probably learned more about cow creamers than he really wanted to
                  know! So naturally enough when he put Peppy up on eBay to let her continue her travels, I had
                  to acquire her.  Oli was kind enough to include one of his many excellent drawings along with
                  Peppy. They now form a proud and happy part of my collection. Peppy has indeed gotten around quite a
                  bit, and it’s nice to know a bit of her history. I sure hope Oli got a good grade! </p>

                <p>These lovely little kneeling creamers are marked for Brad Keeler, mold #711. From <a
                    href="http://california-pottery-index.com/">http://california-pottery-index.com</a> we learn that
                  he “was born in Lincoln, where his father was a ceramic engineer for the local Gladding-McBean plant.
                  After studying art at USC Keeler opened his own Glendale studio where he created naturalistic figures
                  of birds and animals. These were air-brush decorated and enhanced with hand-painted details.
                  Especially popular were the flamingo figures. In the mid-forties Keeler developed a brilliant red
                  glaze which he called Ming Dragon Blood. This lead to the development of a successful line of Chinese
                  Modern housewares...vases, ginger jars, low bowls, smoking sets and more. Business was good enough to
                  build a new large factory on Delay Drive in Los Angeles. While Japanese were flooding the market in
                  the early fifties, Keeler was still expanding, building an even larger factory in San Juan Capistrano
                  in 1952. Tragically that same year, Keeler suffered a deadly heart attack. The company couldn't
                  survive the loss and closed its doors in 1953.” The bidding on eBay went quite high for
                  such small creamers, which is an indication that there must be quite a few Brad Keeler fans out
                  there. </p>

                  Guide for many years….” plus a whole lot more.  My wife and I recently visited Hot Springs National
                  Park, and can understand the attraction to a potter – both a good local source of clay and talc, and
                  lots of potential customers from the myriads of folks who came to visit the hot springs. Sort of like
                  the Brits did in the previous century – make nice but reasonably inexpensive things that folks would
                  like for a souvenir of their vacation.</p>

                <p>Here is a lovely, small and fairly modern English lidded creamer, the only one of its type I have

                  a hill over script “Carefully made in Somerset England”. It turns out that Cheddar Pottery is a Grade
                  II listed Building  on Cufic Lane, Cheddar, Somerset - “Two cottages, now pottery and shop. Early
                  C19”, according to its listing.  The town has a web site, <a href="http://www.cheddarvillage.org.uk/">www.cheddarvillage.org.uk</a>,
                  that notes that its distinguishing feature is Britain’s largest gorge.  Even more fascinating to me
                  however is the following: “The global origin of the word Cheddar comes from over a thousand years ago
                  when the English village was originally referred to as “che-dwr”,  a combination of English and
                  Gaelic terms which became the “Cheddar” village name we know today. If domain names had existed back
                  then, cheddar.org would have rightly belonged to the village elders (nowadays it’s being
                  cyber-squatted by a domain re-sale agent, but that’s another story)…The cheese made using the process
                  which originated here is the second meaning of the word. And in modern slang the word “cheddar” can
                  also mean money or wealth, and also a way of scoring a goal in football. There is also a
                  mobile productivity “app” called Cheddar, and there is a popular word game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_Gorge_(game)#Cheddar_Gorge">“Cheddar
                    Gorge”</a>.   Quite a nice etymology lesson from this tiny cow. </p>

She said she made it for her "Pride 2019" collection, and that she bought the mould from someone whe lived very near Somerset and the Cheddar Pottery...so perhaps it is a near relative.  Whatever, since it was made for Pride UK, this apparently is a 'gay' cow...so one wonders how it ever got to the point of making milk.

                  for the version with little blue flowers (both times).</p>

                  appear to have much age so I decided to let its blue flowers dictate.  I actually bought it just for
                  the humor of the lid, which is obviously a replacement – someone had a lot of fun adding the rather
                  large and fierce fly. </p>
