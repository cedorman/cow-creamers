          <h1>My Story</h1>

          <p align="left"><a href="mystoryimages/dads.jpg"><img src="mystoryimages/dadsr.jpg" alt="Dad's Cow" width="200"
                height="145" hspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a> My father (born 1908) had one cow (<em>right</em>)
            when he was a child. I (born 1940) also had one cow &quot;Bessie&quot;, (<em>below, left</em>) when I was a
            child. When I was a good boy and finished my milk it gave me more. My wife and I got one for each of our
            three boys (born in the ‘60s).  Put 5 cows together, and they start to make a herd.<a href="mystoryimages/bessie.jpg"><img
                src="mystoryimages/bessier.jpg" alt="My first cow, Bessie" width="200" height="145" hspace="10" vspace="10"
                border="0" align="left"></a> </p>
          <br>
          <p>For a long time, I just occasionally picked one up at a flea market; and my price limit was $10. 
            Nevertheless, the collection slowly grew till it numbered 50 or so; we had them on shelves around the top
            of the kitchen, and then when we moved to an older house there were some shelves in the guest bathroom
            where we put them, and our many guests used to get a great kick out of them.<br>
          </p>
		  
          <p>Everything was fine until we moved to London in 1995. From visits to the Victoria and Albert museum, the
            Bermondsey Market, antique shows, the Silver Vaults, and Stoke-on-Trent I learned a bit about the history
            of cow creamers and had a chance to see some superb Staffordshire and silver examples.  At that point I
            decided that I might as well get serious about my own collection, and quite obviously the price limit
            disappeared.  </p>
			
          <p>One other thing happened, in spite of my initial reluctance – the collection expanded to include cow
            shaped vessels designed for pouring but not really intended for cream.  Some of this was by error on my
            part – what I took to be a cow creamer turned out to be designed for wine, water, or some other liquid; or
            some cows that are more or less shaped and styled like creamers are simply too large for any civilized
            cream user, and thus likely intended for milk or water. And, I will confess, as the collection grew I
            decided to add other vessels that met the basic rule of being cow or cow-head shaped and designed to pour
            or dispense liquid – thus pitchers, teapots, calligraphy water droppers, a variety of what can be referred
            to as rhytons (see the history page) or liquor or wine dispensers, some toy milking cows, and even watering
            cans joined in.  Never (or almost never except by error) plain non-pouring cows or salt and pepper shakers
            – although inevitably, given tea and coffee drinkers’ other bad habit (I take mine black by the way) sugar
            bowls, but only when they accompanied a cow creamer.  Thus I’m afraid that this collection is somewhat
            misnamed, although the core and to me the most important parts are the cow-creamers per se, be they new or
            old, metal or earthenware or plastic.  These now number well over a thousand, and if one counts the
            ‘extensions’, the collection probably has a couple thousand items.  And thanks largely but by no means
            solely to eBay (which has had quite an impact both on availability and price) it continues to grow, weekly
            if not daily. <br>
          </p>

          <h3>So what<strong> is a cow creamer, and what extensions are allowed to join the collection?</strong></h3>
		  
		  <blockquote><p>Since  you will find when you peruse the following list that the collection has grown from simply small cow shaped creamers to a number of other 'vessels' capable of holding and pouring liquids, it's probably best to first state what is <strong>NOT </strong>included: Basically, cow figurines ,vases, mugs, cookie jars, etc. They have to pour. This eliminates a number of interesting things like the lovely early Delft and French cow figures, nativity scene cows, the myriad and very humerous Cow Parade figures and statues (there are come Cow Parade creamers and a couple teapots), and most 'vache feves' (or 'beans', the cute little figures that are put in King Cakes or just mnade for collectors - there are literally hundreds of them, check Ebay for a glimpse of the diversity). If I expanded to any of those, I'd need a couple more barns.</p></blockquote>.

          animal creamers. And there are one or two 'sports' like this Beswick humorous 'fake' cow creamer. </td>

          <p>Finally, this Vietnamese cow (water buffalo) definitely has two holes. It is, however, an opium pipe (my
            one and only), so it hardly qualifies as a creamer or a rhyton or any such, but I couldn’t resist it. It
            has been well used (though not by me I assure you).</p>

  <p>For those of you who search eBay…the term ‘cow creamer’ has almost become generic (there are generally over 1500
    on auction…), and I’ve seen all kinds of animal creamers/pitchers being sold as cow creamers (I’ve been fooled by
    some). Cows of interest to me are sometimes also found on eBay under cow or bull pitcher, jug, and teapot. If you
    do decide to shop on eBay be very careful about prices - many sellers seem to have no realistic idea of value, and
    there are always some looking for a sucker. Same goes for other sites like etsy, mercari, and catawiki.</p>
  <p> Do I have duplicates? Sure - sometimes deliberate, e.g. to upgrade to a higher quality version, sometimes by
    mistake.  Also, there are a number of cow creamers that are made by several potteries, or come in a variety of
    colors or decorations, though I have made no attempt to be 'complete' in that regard.</p>
