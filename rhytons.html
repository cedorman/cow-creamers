          <h1>Rhytons</h1>
          <p>
            <h2 align="left"> plus Nandi and a few other liquid dispensing vessels</h2>
          </p>

          <p>My Webster’s third International Dictionary defines rhyton as “an ancient Greek
            drinking horn of pottery, usu. having the base in the form of the head of an animal,
            woman, or mythological creature.” Wikipedia is much more expansive, stating
            “A <strong>rhyton</strong> (plural <strong>rhytons</strong> or, following the Greek
            plural, <strong>rhyta</strong>) is a container from which fluids were intended to be
            drunk or to be poured in some ceremony such
            as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>. The
            English word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhyton" title="wiktionary:rhyton">rhyton</a> originates
            in the
            ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek
            language">Greek</a>
            word ῥυτόν (<em>rhy̆tón</em> or <em>rhŭtón</em>). The conical rhyton
            form has been known in the Aegean region since
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>,
            or the 2nd millennium BC. However, it was by no means confined to that region. Similar
            in form to, and perhaps originating from,
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_horn" title="Drinking horn">drinking
              horn</a>, it has been widespread over Eurasia since prehistoric times. (note: I saw some
            great Parthian examples in a museum in Ashkabad, Turkmenistan) … Many vessels considered
            rhytons featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a conical constriction at
            the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that one scooped wine or water from a
            storage vessel or similar source, held it up, unstoppered the hole with one's thumb, and
            let the fluid run into the mouth (or onto the ground
            in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>)… Rhyta
            were often used for liquids that needed straining, such as wine, beer and oil. Some
            rhyta were used in blood rituals and animal sacrifice. In these cases, the blood may
            have been thinned with wine. Some vessels were modeled after the animal they were
            intended to be used with during ritual, but this was not always the case… Rhyta occur
            among the remains of civilizations speaking different languages and language groups in
            and around the Near and Middle East, such as Persia, from the second millennium BC. They
            are often shaped like animals' heads or horns and can be very ornate and compounded with
            precious metals and stones.”  The Google ‘Images of Rhyton’ page has some 181,000
            pictures, and while the majority are of the horn-shaped form, there are also many that
            feature a full-bodied caracature of a cow, bull, or other creature, molded much like the
            ‘modern’ cow creamer or pitcher.  Indeed, some of those pictures are of works from
            modern artists’ (including William Morris). </p>

          <p>This section of my collection includes few of the very fancy ancient (BCE) rhytons like those shown on the History page. – most are either in
            museums or extremely expensive. It does however have some that are representative of the early ones, a number acquired on eBay from the highly 
			reputable MDAntiquitiesfirm in the UK  (most of the terracotta ones seem to have come from a collection in Canada) plus a 
			few that appear to be copies of ancient ones, as
            well as modern vessels that are designed for uses similar to those for which rhytons were intended. Thus
            here I include the Peruvian Toritos de Pucara, which originally were used to hold chicha and blood for the
            cattle branding ceremony as described on the Places page. Probably inappropriately, I have also put here a
            number of Spanish bull caricature vessels designed for wine or oil and vinegar (popular tourist items), as
            well as other cow or bull caricatures that might best be termed ‘cruets’ but which have shapes somewhat
            reminiscent of some of the early rhytons. And, I’ve snuck in a couple liquor dispensers and what I believe
            to be an old Chinese soy pot, for lack of a better place.</p>
			
				<p>More appropriately, I have added a section at the
            bottom of this page for my Hindu Nandi – designed for libations of holy water in Hindu Temples devoted to
            Shiva – since they, and the somewhat similar cow-headed vessels used to hold ghee to feed the holy flame, have
            ritualistic purposes. </p>

It's too small to be useful for drinking (except perhaps for a very tiny Viking) and is unglazed so not really suitable for liquids meant to be consumed. He also stated that it's unusual in that it bears a fertility symbol (which I have been unable to locate).  But then, he also said exactly the same thing about a similar gost's head piece, so I am beginning to doubt all the above. And, later he advertised an identical piece with another story, so it seems it's a modern fake.

It was mailed to me from New York. OK...I'd give it about a 3% probability of being as advertised. If it is, great. No way that I know of to verify...but then I didn't expect a lot, just thought the shape and round ears and stubby front legs were interesting. It doesn't take a lot of room on the shelf.</p></td>

The English seller acquired it at a "very fanous" toy and doll auction, where the specialist informed her it was Edwardian, made by Wedgewood. The jasper coloration and beautiful molding certainly attests to that origin. Doll houses were very populaer in that era which is what likely induced Wedgewood to enter the game(the seller has a few others by them from the same coillection and auction, but this was the only cow/bull). </p></td>

It came to me from an antique dealer in Ebbs Austria who seems to largely specialize in coins. He kindly told me that he acquired it from the heirs of a serious collector from Munich, Germany who had bought it in an antique shop in Oslo, Norway. It is interesting in that it has both a raised fill hole, and a pour hole...in its forehead. I tried if and it does pour, albeit a bit sloppily. Perhaps it was intended for a ritualistic liquid somewhat more viscous than water. </p></blockquote>

				"The bull was one of the paramount religious symbols of Eastern Mediterranean peoples in the Late 
				Bronze Age and was linked with fertility as well as with supernatural strength. It frequently 
				assumed the form of major male deities, such as Apis in Egypt, Anu in Mesopotamia, El in Canaan, 
				and so on, while in Minoan Crete it developed into a symbol of both religious and royal authority. 
				In Cyprus, the religious connotations of the bull are attested already from the Early Bronze Age,
				when clay bucrania were placed on top of sanctuary models. They become even more obvious in the 
				Late Bronze Age with the production of several bull rhyta and the adornment of altars with stone
				or clay bull horns. Please be aware that, due to the fact that our products are either 
				individually cast, carved, hand painted and hand finished, there will inevitably be minor 
				variations in size, colour and texture." It is indeed a very fine piece.</p>

                  Thus they certainly meet the basic (expanded) definition. They have become a very
                  popular souvenir of Peru, and also are often found in pairs on newly-completed roofs

                  artisans, creating ‘alasitas’ which are tiny items reflecting wishes. Novics states that its mission
                  is to spread happiness to both the artisans and to their customers, and their items come beautifully
                  (and safely) wrapped, and in the case of these two, with little dolls attached to the red bows.</p>

                <p>Finally for Peru, here is a small facsimile of how the Peruvians often
                  display the toritos on their homes. To quote the seller who was from Cuzco “The
                  torito of pucara is a ceramic handicrafts of the district of Pupuja, in the province
                  of Azángaro, Peruvian department of Puno. It is a totemic symbol known as qonopas
                  (Quechua) and / or Illas (Aymara), used in Andean rituals and ceremonies of
                  protection, happiness and fertility in married life. In the perception of the Andean
                  settlers that the pair of pucará toritos on the roof is a sign of protection and
                  happiness in the home, it is an Andean duality that represents the husband and the
                  woman that represent the fusion of positive and negative energies that the
                  Equilibrium And the common good. At present, this piece has become a symbol of
                  Peruvian Andean identity. The singular finish of the toritos are imperfect figures,
                  of rough aspect, although they are charming and handmade in all ways. The objects
                  are tied with the sheepskin and the black color is because they are destined to be
                  buried in the day of the Pachamama the 1 of August of each year.”</p>

I could not find a web site for them, but a number of other sites feature their pottery and tell us that the dark red clay from this region is very dense, and that their work is intended to reproduce the Spanish Romantic style of the 14c., thus the somewhat primitive designs and only the  black and green colors of that period.  This quite idiosyncratic cow or bull is dated ’57 and came to me from the Netherlands. The 'puckered' moith and large horns are reminiscent of other Spanish bull cruets and wine jugs, but the body and legs seem to be unique to ths family.  The price on Ebay was quite low for work from the Pungter studio, but shipping made up for it.</p></blockquote>

                  - are likely intended to hold olive oil or something similar - but they probably have a right to be
                  on this page given that their shape is quite reminiscent of some of early ritualistic vessels. Then
                  again, for those on a Mediterranean diet, use of olive oil can indeed be considered a ritual. The
                  first one of these that my wife and I got was the reddish brown clay one with the earrings in the
                  middle of the upper picture. We purchased it in a shop in San Gimignano, Italy, in 1990. It carries
                  fond memories of a pleasant vacation in central Italy, and a fascinating old
                  town of nine towers.  Great wine in the area, too! The only other one of these
                  that’s marked is the dark brown one on the far left of the upper picture: from Enesco, and made in
                  Japan. Perhaps it should be called a "Toro Nipponico".  The little grey-blue cup with cow head spout
                  on the far right in the lower picture is hand made, and almost certainly comes from somewhere in the
                  US; the eBay seller was in Arizona. I conclude that the traditional Curnca Bull has indeed become
                  world-renowned.</p>

                <p>As I understand it (I get confused by Hindu deities), Nandi the white bull is Shiva’s vahana or
                  vehicle, the mount on which he rides. A note from the Philadelphia Museum of Art adds that “Shiva is
                  a great ascetic whose power emerges as contained sexual energy. Appropriately, he is accompanied by
                  the virile bull. An image of Nandi sits in the hall or porch of temples dedicated to Shiva, facing
                  into the sanctum like the primary devotee that it is.”  In ancient India, he was also an independent
                  deity known as Nandikeshvara, the Lord of Joy, represented as a man with a bull’s head.  The folks
                  who sold me this lovely older copper version  – which comes from Jodhpur in Rajasthan – said that
                  these pots are used by priests to spray holy water on the devotees who come to worship at Shiva’s
                  shrine, or are carried by holy men to hold and  disperse holy water from the Ganges.   As you will
                  note, this Nandi arrived very carefully packaged for safety in an old tin for Kashmir Snow Beauty

                  seller. It contained a small leaflet entitled “Butter pot” that said “In India, the cow is believed
                  to be “close to God” and can fulfill dreams and desires. This brass cow’s head kettle is used to hold
                  the clarified butter, called Ghee, which fuels the holy flame that is kept lit at all time in Hindu
                  Temples”.  As it turns out I had a few others of similar size and shape that I now believe to be
                  other versions of ‘cows’ not bulls, used for Ghee.  They certainly are of a different shape and
                  character than the holy water nandis…but nonetheless because of their use in Hindu temples I believe

                  Wikipedia where I learned first that “Abhisheka, also called Abhishekam, is conducted by priests, by
                  pouring libations on the image of the deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras.
                  Usually, offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, Panchaamrutam, sesame oil, rosewater,
                  sandalwood paste may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being
                  performed. This ritual is routinely performed in some Hindu and Jain temples. "Rudraabhisheka"
                  (Abhisheka of Rudra) is performed on Shiva lingams.” Seeking further, I also found out that “A pandit
                  or pundit is a scholar and a teacher, particularly one skilled in the Sanskrit language, who has
                  mastered the four Vedic scriptures, Hindu rituals, Hindu law, religion, music, and/or philosophy
                  under a Guru in a Gurukul or has been tutored under the ancient Vedic Guru-Shishya academic

                  presumably brought it back as a souvenir.  The well crafted tiny copper Nandi was said to be 70-80
                  years old, and used in temples. The largest one, with a stand under its chin and with internal
                  ridges, was sold to me as a pot or ‘ash tray’ (which I doubt), but I have also seen an identical one
                  described on eBay as a Kharal, which is essentially a mortar for grinding opium and making ‘opium
                  water’ which is then taken through the bull’s mouth. Perhaps some kind Hindu can enlighten me – I can
                  only say that I’m learning, slowly, that holy cows and bulls from India can have many manifestations
                  and uses.</p>
