          <h1>Rhytons</h1>
          <p>
            <h2 align="left"> plus Nandi and a few other liquid dispensing vessels</h2>
          </p>

          <p>My Webster’s third International Dictionary defines rhyton as “an ancient Greek
            drinking horn of pottery, usu. having the base in the form of the head of an animal,
            woman, or mythological creature.” Wikipedia is much more expansive, stating
            “A <strong>rhyton</strong> (plural <strong>rhytons</strong> or, following the Greek
            plural, <strong>rhyta</strong>) is a container from which fluids were intended to be
            drunk or to be poured in some ceremony such
            as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>. The
            English word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhyton" title="wiktionary:rhyton">rhyton</a> originates
            in the
            ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek
            language">Greek</a>
            word ῥυτόν (<em>rhy̆tón</em> or <em>rhŭtón</em>). The conical rhyton
            form has been known in the Aegean region since
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>,
            or the 2nd millennium BC. However, it was by no means confined to that region. Similar
            in form to, and perhaps originating from,
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_horn" title="Drinking horn">drinking
              horn</a>, it has been widespread over Eurasia since prehistoric times. (note: I saw some
            great Parthian examples in a museum in Ashkabad, Turkmenistan) … Many vessels considered
            rhytons featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a conical constriction at
            the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that one scooped wine or water from a
            storage vessel or similar source, held it up, unstoppered the hole with one's thumb, and
            let the fluid run into the mouth (or onto the ground
            in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>)… Rhyta
            were often used for liquids that needed straining, such as wine, beer and oil. Some
            rhyta were used in blood rituals and animal sacrifice. In these cases, the blood may
            have been thinned with wine. Some vessels were modeled after the animal they were
            intended to be used with during ritual, but this was not always the case… Rhyta occur
            among the remains of civilizations speaking different languages and language groups in
            and around the Near and Middle East, such as Persia, from the second millennium BC. They
            are often shaped like animals' heads or horns and can be very ornate and compounded with
            precious metals and stones.”  The Google ‘Images of Rhyton’ page has some 181,000
            pictures, and while the majority are of the horn-shaped form, there are also many that
            feature a full-bodied caracature of a cow, bull, or other creature, molded much like the
            ‘modern’ cow creamer or pitcher.  Indeed, some of those pictures are of works from
            modern artists’ (including William Morris). </p>

          <p>This section of my collection does not include any of the ancient (BCE) rhytons – those are either in
            museums or extremely expensive. It does however have a few that appear to be copies of ancient ones, as
            well as modern vessels that are designed for uses similar to those for which rhytons were intended. Thus
            here I include the Peruvian Toritos de Pucara, which originally were used to hold chicha and blood for the
            cattle branding ceremony as described on the Places page. Probably inappropriately, I have also put here a
            number of Spanish bull caricature vessels designed for wine or oil and vinegar (popular tourist items), as
            well as other cow or bull caricatures that might best be termed ‘cruets’ but which have shapes somewhat
            reminiscent of some of the early rhytons. And, I’ve snuck in a couple liquor dispensers and what I believe
            to be an old Chinese soy pot, for lack of a better place. More appropriately, I have added a section at the
            bottom of the page for my Hindu Nandi – designed for libations of holy water in Hindu Temples devoted to
            Shiva – since they, and the somewhat similar vessels used to hold ghee to feed the holy flame, have
            ritualistic purposes. </p>

              <td>Well, this was sold as a rhyton, and although it has no holes it does seem to be
                a cute little bull effigy.  It was said to be Amlash, 1st millennium BC, and came
                certified as original from an antiquities dealer
                in <u></u><u></u>Cyprus<u></u><u></u>. It was sufficiently inexpensive as these
                things go that I thought it would make a good introductory contribution to this part
                of the collection.  Amlash is a fairly generic term referring to a geographic region
                in northern <u></u><u></u>Iran<u></u><u></u>, and apparently most of the artifacts
                from there date to the 9th-8th century <u></u>BCE<u></u>. A check of the photos on
                google shows that hump backed bulls seemed to be popular items for Amlash
                rhytons.</td>

                <p>This is a Peruvian Torito de Pucara. Rhyton ‘purists’ would probably object
                  because there is no Greek heritage here, but rather a combination of Spanish and
                  indigenous Andean.  However as noted in other places where I have displayed these
                  lovely bull vessels, they were initially designed for rituals associated with the
                  cattle-branding ceremony, to hold a mixture of blood and chicha (corn-based beer). 
                  Thus they certainly meet the basic (expanded) definition. They have become a very
                  popular souvenir of Peru, and also are often found in pairs on newly-completed roofs
                  of houses, bearing a bottle each of chicha and holy water.</p>

                <p>Here are two more Toritos, both acquired from Novica which sells products
                  from artisans around the world to folks like me.  The large greyish ons is by Walter
                  Jose Acosta, from the Huambo province in the Amazon region of Peru, who is
                  dedicated to perpetuating the beauty of Peruvian ceramic art. The little black one
                  is by Maribel Posso Olivares who with a friend now heads a workshop with about 12
                  artisans, creating ‘alasitas’ which are tiny items reflecting wishes. Novics states that its mission
                  is to spread happiness to both the artisans and to their customers, and their items come beautifully
                  (and safely) wrapped, and in the case of these two, with little dolls attached to the red bows.</p>

                  the hole in its nose. When my wife and I visited Peru we encountered a very large
                  number of marvelous old pottery figures, some quite scatological and all fanciful,
                  in the museums. As noted above, bulls were not native to the area so this type of
                  figure appears only after the Spanish conquest.</p>

                <p>Finally for Peru, here is a small facsimile of how the Peruvians often
                  display the toritos on their homes. To quote the seller who was from Cuzco “The
                  torito of pucara is a ceramic handicrafts of the district of Pupuja, in the province
                  of Azángaro, Peruvian department of Puno. It is a totemic symbol known as qonopas
                  (Quechua) and / or Illas (Aymara), used in Andean rituals and ceremonies of
                  protection, happiness and fertility in married life. In the perception of the Andean
                  settlers that the pair of pucará toritos on the roof is a sign of protection and
                  happiness in the home, it is an Andean duality that represents the husband and the
                  woman that represent the fusion of positive and negative energies that the
                  Equilibrium And the common good. At present, this piece has become a symbol of
                  Peruvian Andean identity. The singular finish of the toritos are imperfect figures,
                  of rough aspect, although they are charming and handmade in all ways. The objects
                  are tied with the sheepskin and the black color is because they are destined to be
                  buried in the day of the Pachamama the 1 of August of each year.”</p>

                  wine (or blood).  The red glazed ceramic one came to me from Ontario Canada and the
                  only information the seller could provide is that he got it at an estate sale from
                  someone who had an extensive pottery collection, and that it’s most likely Blue

                  sites and a knowledgeable UK seller, it is an
                  example of Cuenca’s most typical pottery item, the so called "Toro Ibérico"
                  (Iberian Bull) which  was originally created by the master potter Pedro Mercedes who
                  was inspired by an Iberian bull head from the 7c Moorish period which was found in

                  family gifts representing the spirit and courage of the Spanish or Iberian bull, a reputation gained
                  from bullfights. These cute little bulls proved to be very popular and have morphed into souvenirs,
                  as well as into vessels used - like those above - for oil and vinegar or perhaps wine.</p>

                  - are likely intended to hold olive oil or something similar - but they probably have a right to be
                  on this page given that their shape is quite reminiscent of some of early ritualistic vessels. Then
                  again, for those on a Mediterranean diet, use of olive oil can indeed be considered a rirual. The
                  first one of these that my wife and I got was the reddish brown clay one with the earrings in the
                  middle of the upper picture. We pourchased it in a shop in San Gimignano, Italy, in 1990. It carries
                  fond memories of a pleasant vacation in central Italy, and a fascinating old
                  town of nine towers.  Great wine in the area, too! The only other one of these
                  that’s marked is the dark brown one on the far left of the upper picture: from Enesco, and made in
                  Japan. Perhaps it should be called a "Toro Nipponico".  The little grey-blue cup with cow head spout
                  on the far right in the lower picture is hand made, and almost certainly comes from somewhere in the
                  US; the eBay seller was in Arizona. I conclude that the traditional Curnca Bull has indeed become
                  world-reknowned.</p>

                <p>As I understand it (I get confused by Hindu deities), Nandi the white bull is Shiva’s vahana or
                  vehicle, the mount on which he rides. A note from the Philadelphia Museum of Art adds that “Shiva is
                  a great ascetic whose power emerges as contained sexual energy. Appropriately, he is accompanied by
                  the virile bull. An image of Nandi sits in the hall or porch of temples dedicated to Shiva, facing
                  into the sanctum like the primary devotee that it is.”  In ancient India, he was also an independent
                  deity known as Nandikeshvara, the Lord of Joy, represented as a man with a bull’s head.  The folks
                  who sold me this lovely older copper version  – which comes from Jodhpur in Rajasthan – said that
                  these pots are used by priests to spray holy water on the devotees who come to worship at Shiva’s
                  shrine, or are carried by holy men to hold and  disperse holy water from the Ganges.   As you will
                  note, this Nandi arrived very carefully packaged for safety in an old tin for Kashmir Snow Beauty
                  Aids.</p>

                <p>I had thought that all these bull or cow shaped Hindu ritual vessels were models of Shiva’s bull,
                  used for holy water. Then the large and rather plain oval bodied ‘cow’ on the left arrived, from a US
                  seller. It contained a small leaflet entitled “Butter pot” that said “In India, the cow is believed
                  to be “close to God” and can fulfill dreams and desires. This brass cow’s head kettle is used to hold
                  the clarified butter, called Ghee, which fuels the holy flame that is kept lit at all time in Hindu
                  Temples”.  As it turns out I had a few others of similar size and shape that I now believe to be
                  other versions of ‘cows’ not bulls, used for Ghee.  They certainly are of a different shape and
                  character than the holy water nandis…but nonetheless because of their use in Hindu temples I believe
                  they belong in this part of the collection </p>

                  hollow horns.  I don’t know if this has any ritual significance, but from my perspective it certainly

                  seller. The add for it on eBay stated: ““All our Spiritual Products Are Spiritually activated With
                  Mantras & Puja’s also known as Abhisheka by our Panditji Priest without any extra charges. Ideal to
                  hang in temple over Shiva Linga – very auspicious to do Shiva Pooja” Naturally this sent me to
                  Wikipedia where I learned first that “Abhisheka, also called Abhishekam, is conducted by priests, by
                  pouring libations on the image of the deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras.
                  Usually, offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, Panchaamrutam, sesame oil, rosewater,
                  sandalwood paste may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being
                  performed. This ritual is routinely performed in some Hindu and Jain temples. "Rudraabhisheka"
                  (Abhisheka of Rudra) is performed on Shiva lingams.” Seeking further, I also found out that “A pandit
                  or pundit is a scholar and a teacher, particularly one skilled in the Sanskrit language, who has
                  mastered the four Vedic scriptures, Hindu rituals, Hindu law, religion, music, and/or philosophy
                  under a Guru in a Gurukul or has been tutored under the ancient Vedic Guru-Shishya academic
                  tradition. The English loan word pundit is derived from it.”  </p>

                <p>Finally, here are three open-topped Nandis – the largest and smallest came from Sunil Arts &amp;
                  Engg Works in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, and the silver colored one from a seller in the US who
                  presumably brought it back as a souvenir.  The well crafted tiny copper Nandi was said to be 70-80
                  years old, and used in temples. The largest one, with a stand under its chin and with internal
                  ridges, was sold to me as a pot or ‘ash tray’ (which I doubt), but I have also seen an identical one
                  described on eBay as a Kharal, which is essentially a mortar for grinding opium and making ‘opium
                  water’ which is then taken through the bull’s mouth. Perhaps some kind Hindu can enlighten me – I can
                  only say that I’m learning, slowly, that holy cows and bulls from India can have many manifestations
                  and uses.</p>
