		    <p>As noted in the theme descriptions, the main thing that distinguishes what I’m here
            calling ‘pitchers’ from ‘creamers’ is size. Many of these are a foot or more tall and
            hold over a quart, so pretty obviously they were designed to hold water or milk (or wine
            in some cases), not cream. The one in the middle here which is almost 12" tall, weird as
            it may be, is thus a pitcher. It's surrounded by a couple normal sized creamers for
            comparison. There are also some traditional 'pitchers', meaning vessels with a single
            hole, plus a lip of sorts to guide the liquid when pouring. All of these of course have
            to be either a whole cow or a head...with minor exceptions for a couple that I found
            irresistable. </p>

                Hungary, so maybe not since the pitcher hails from Portugal.) It bears a seal from
                Boidallo Pinheiro, Est 1884. They have an excellent web site (Google will translate it)
                which tells us that “Raphael Bordallo Pinheiro is one of the most influential people of
                nineteenth century Portuguese culture, with a remarkable production in relation to the
                areas of humoristic drawing, caricature and ceramic creation. His work represents an
                unsettling, timely reality and a fundamental document for political, social, cultural
                and ideological study of a time period…In 1884 Bordallo began his ceramics production at
                the Fábrica de Faianças in Caldas, revealing pieces of great technical, artistic and
                creative quality, developing tiles, panels, pots, table centerpieces, vase busts,
                fountain basins, pitchers, plates, perfume bottles, vases and gigantic animals, etc.” as
                well as a lot more.

                  by a (unknown) South Carolina folk artist, according to the antique dealer from whom I acquired them

                  have been making a wide variety of porcelain pottery. They have gathered together some of the most
                  talented ceramic artists in the country, and most importantly, they have given them the place, tools
                  and support to do the work they love and grow and prosper as artists. We make a promise to our

The black and white pudgy cylinder of a cow next to the blue one bears the incised mark of © 1992, B.W., Taiwan.  The pink nosed companion to the big red cow seems very happy with its blue bow and is marked Japan, © B&D (who or whatever that is).</p>

                  one with pinwheels. The one next to it, with the purple nose and brown bell, is
                  incised for “Caldas de Raihna, Portugal”. Next to it, in black and white, is one
                  from a paint-it yourself ceramic shop, marked “For Mom, love Tom and Cindy”.  The
                  mottled brown one on the right would appear to be from a similar mold, but the ad
                  on eBay stated that the seller bought it from a “’gentleman’s private collection’,
                  being sold because of his divorce, which was mostly top quality glass and pottery;
                  he claimed it was English, c 1860-1880.” The glaze does seem not unusual for that
                  period, though I have no way of knowing for sure. True or not, I fell for it and
                  if it is true, since this is a nice and widely used design, it may well have been
                  an early prototype from which the others were copied.</p></blockquote>

                  Genuine Delft”. The Biltmore estate was built by George Vanderbilt and is in Ashville, NC.  You can visit the house and hardens, tour, eat, stay there(3 levels of accomodation from expensive to oh-my-god), and buy all kinds of stuff. It's actually quite nice, if ostentatious.  The white pitcher bears the stamp of “Maryland China, Taiwan”, and I’d guess is made from a copy of the Delft mold. At least I’d be willing to bet the Dutch didn’t copy the Taiwanese in this case…albeit the Delft blue coloring does of course have a Chinese origin.  Maryland China has a showroom in Reisterstown, MD but I assume most of their products are made overseas; they have a nice web page to peddle their products but it doesn't tell a lot about them except that they started in 1910.   </p>

                      Company. The ‘Pearl China and Pottery Company’ was established by Dennis and George Singer in
                      1931, in East Liverpool, Ohio. This city is sometimes known as the ‘Pottery Capitol of the
                      Nation’, and its Museum of Ceramics lists dozens of pottery companies that operated there. Pearl
                      Co. was designed to serve both as a pottery and as a distributor of goods from other
                      manufacturers. Pottery production stopped in 1960, but the company remained open as a popular
                      retail outlet until late summer 2009, switching owners to friends of the Singers a couple times
                      before the last owner retired. As far as I know this was the only cow mold (#635) that Pearl
                      used, and these were the only three colors in which they were produced. From the frequency with
                      which they appear on eBay, they were quite popular at one time. Pearl apparently did make some
                      for other locations or organizations to sell as souvenirs –a yellow one with a Pikes Peak picture
                      is shown on the Advertising and Souvenirs page. </p>

                  1988, and  Fitz and Floyd’s lovely Heidi Holstein, of 1994, 1 ½ quart size. These two were also shown
                  on the Heads page, Cowmen was in My Story, and Heidi was also featured in Favorite Brands along with
                  some other Fitz and Floyd items. Fitz and Floyd are discusses on the Favorite Brands page.  Vandor's web site notes that "In August 2018, Vandor joined the Bioworld family, bringing over 60 years of experience providing high quality home goods designed for living." They are headquartered in  Salt Lake City Utah with offices in China and the Philippines (and I bet their stuff is made there and not in Utah!) I didn't know Bioworld so naturally I hit their web page that says "Bioworld is a collection of designers, brand strategist, marketers and retail experts devoted to creating new experiences for the pop culture consumer. The biggest brands in entertainment trust Bioworld for their licensed merchandise. . We translate their stories into collections that enable fans to redefine their personal expression.

                  to be rather pricey these days. Regal Pottery was established in Antioch, IL in 1938, and was
                  purchased by the Royal China and Novelty Company a couple years later. It was apparently well known
                  for Jim Beam decanters, the Old MacDonald Farm and Little Red Riding Hood series, and cookie jars; it
                  closed in June 1992. The orange clay milk carton with black hooves and shiny white spot came from a
                  fancy ceramic shop in the UK in 1996, and is marked with a handwritten “ii95, ©".</p></blockquote>

                  It’s marked for St. Michael, mold #2233. From Wikipedia I learned that the St Michael brand was
                  introduced in 1928 to designate quality items made by the firm of N. Corah & Sons of Leicester
                  and sold through Marks & Spenser. By 1950, Wikipedia notes, “virtually all goods in Marks & 
                  Spenser were sold under the St Michael brand”, which was used as a ‘quality guarantee’. In 2000,
                  Marks & Spenser dropped the St Michael name in favor of their own brand.</p>

                  “VINO” embossed on its right side and a connected large T and small R on the left,
                  is apparently the same ceramic pitcher, but beautifully wrapped in varnished
                  goatskin parchment. The seller indicated that, although unmarked, it was most
                  likely attributed to Aldo Tura, an Italian artist-craftsman-designer who began his
                  furniture and decorative object business in the 1930’s (see www.tura.it). I’ve
                  poked around a bit and found that Tura did indeed make quite a number of
                  parchment-wrapped bar accessories as well as bars and other furniture, and some of
                  the accessories seem to have been marked with a green label stuck to the bottom,
                  which may have fallen off of this piece. If it is indeed a Tura then I got a heck
                  of a bargain…and if not, at least I’ve now got a really classy goatskin-parchment
                  wrapped vino jug.</p>
                <p>Update: Since I acquired the leather-wrapped bull I’ve seen several others on offer in various
                  conditions and with different brands. One, in pretty tough shape, had a label that read “Artesania
                  Raymon, Made in Spain, Ref 125”. I’ve not been able to find out anything about this company except
                  that it’s in Valencia, and has made a variety of other leather-wrapped glass and pottery items. I
                  think this attribution is more likely than Tura.</p>

                  cow creamer in every country we visit. A while back we went to Costa Rica for a couple
                  weeks of birding, and this was the only cow we found, in a ‘porcellan’ shop in San Jose
                  that specializes in peddling oriental gee-gaws to the Ticos.</p>

                    <p>While we’re in the ‘odd for the collection’ mode, here’s a wild one – designed to hold
                      a quart milk carton. The seller states that it was designed by Judy Shelby Lotus, for her
                      ‘Moo Dairy” collection. I can’t find anything about her or her collection on the web, but
                      both her name and “Moo Dairy” are prominently displayed on the pitcher. If nothing else,
                      this is certainly different…</p></blockquote>

                <p>Speaking of odd, this is a blown glass liquid holder – the seller said either a dog
                  or a cow, so naturally I assumed it was the latter although I do harbor some serious
                  doubts. It probably came with a cork and metal stopper in the snout. The attribution is
                  possibly to Orrefors Kosta Borda AB, a Swedish utility and art glass company that has a
                  history dating back to 1742 (and since 2005 has been part of the New Wave Group), but more
                  likely (from what I can find on the web) to John Erik Hugo Gehlin (1889-1953) a Swedish
                  glass artist and designer at Gulla Skrufs glassworks which was in production from 1893 to
                  1995 and was once owned by Orrefors. One way or the other, it for sure seems to be
                  Swedish.</p>

                  metal cow (as well as four birds and “cream half milk half”) on the lid, and I justified
                  buying it because it’s small and much more likely to see daily use than any of the others,
                  if only because my wife likes it.</p>
