          <p>As noted in the theme descriptions, the main thing that distinguishes what I’m here calling ‘pitchers’
            from ‘creamers’ is size. Many of these are a foot or more tall and hold over a quart, so pretty obviously
            they were designed to hold water or milk (or wine in some cases), not cream. The one in the middle here,
            weird as it may be, is thus a pitcher. There are also some traditional 'pitchers', meaning vessels with a
            single hole, plus a lip of sorts to guide the liquid when pouring. All of these of course have to be either
            a whole cow or a head...with minor exceptions for a couple that I found irresistable. </p>

                ‘bull’s blood’ perhaps (albeit that famous dark red wine – Egri Bikaver – is from
                Hungary, so maybe not since the pitcher hails from Portugal.) It bears a seal from
                Boidallo Pinheiro, Est 1884. They have an excellent web site (Google will translate it)
                which tells us that “Raphael Bordallo Pinheiro is one of the most influential people of
                nineteenth century Portuguese culture, with a remarkable production in relation to the
                areas of humoristic drawing, caricature and ceramic creation. His work represents an
                unsettling, timely reality and a fundamental document for political, social, cultural
                and ideological study of a time period…In 1884 Bordallo began his ceramics production at
                the Fábrica de Faianças in Caldas, revealing pieces of great technical, artistic and
                creative quality, developing tiles, panels, pots, table centerpieces, vase busts,
                fountain basins, pitchers, plates, perfume bottles, vases and gigantic animals, etc.” as
                well as a lot more.

                  sort of football shaped and with no legs, is marked “©1992, B.W., Taiwan” (it cost me 99 cents). The
                  large bodied cow with the polka dot tail for a handle is copyrighted for Clay Art, also made in
                  Taiwan. For some reason this is one I keep forgetting I already have, so the collection now has four
                  of them. The round one with the daisy necklace holds two quarts, and is marked for OCI, Omnibus,
                  Japan. It appears frequently on eBay. Both of the ones to the right of it are from Taiwan. </p>

                  China. It actually has a matching sugar bowl, so in spite of its size it might as well have gone in
                  the creamer pile. The cow with the chicken beside it is from Certified International Corporation, ©
                  Coco Dowley, and was made in Taiwan. The cow on the right is unmarked. </p>

                  &amp; Co was well known for their cookie jars, teapots, and other whimsical pieces. The trademark was
                  federally registered on 7/23/84 in Santa Fe, N.M., and then the owners – Allen Walker and wife Jenny
                  Lind - closed it down after a few years. Jenny did the design work while Allen worked on the mold
                  design. As of late 2016 they are still in Santa Fe, producing primarily dinnerware under the company
                  name of Rainbow Gate, established in 1994.<strong></strong></p>

                  owned by George Sigal, who with his sons produced fairly large items like this pitcher from the 1950s
                  to 70s in a pottery located near the Cal State LA campus. I guess one would have to ask George why

                <p>Here are four variations on the ‘begging’ theme, from different ends of the earth. The pitcher on
                  the left, while unmarked, I believe is from Japan like the one with pinwheels. The one next to it,
                  with the purple nose and brown bell, is incised for “Caldas de Raihna, Portugal”. Next to it, in
                  black and white, is one from a paint-it yourself ceramic shop, marked “For Mom, love Tom and Cindy”.
                  The mottled brown one on the right would appear to be from a similar mold, but the ad on eBay stated
                  that the seller bought it from a “’gentlemen’s private collection’, being sold because of his
                  divorce, which was mostly top quality glass and pottery; he claimed it was English, c 1860-1880.” The
                  glaze does seem not unusual for that period, though I have no way of knowing for sure. True or not, I
                  fell for it.</p>

                  deriving its name from its original location. This piece is dated 2004, and was created with

                  same set. The one quart milk carton that has the cow with the blue collar is ©Russ Berrie &amp; Co.,
                  and was made in Sri Lanka. Its half gallon neighbor, wearing the yellow bandanna, is from Taiwan, and

                  shown above as coming from Pelzman Designs, because it turns out this Vandor cow also has a Pelzman
                  designs sticker. They’re quite similar, but the one without the sunglasses has significantly larger
                  front legs and, although you can’t see it here, a larger tail tip. Apparently Vandor has an affinity
                  for skinny legs. www.vandorproducts.com notes that they’re proud of “making retro cool since
                  1957…suppliers of hip and functional products”. They create and distribute over 150 designs per year,
                  and are based in Salt Lake City with offices in Hong Kong, China, and the Philippines. I haven’t been
                  able to find out much about Pelzman, but an eBay search indicates that they do a whole lot of work
                  for Vandor, presumably among others.</p>

                    <p>As the mark here clearly shows, these three rather fierce looking cows come from the Pearl China
                      Company. The ‘Pearl China and Pottery Company’ was established by Dennis and George Singer in
                      1931, in East Liverpool, Ohio. This city is sometimes known as the ‘Pottery Capitol of the
                      Nation’, and its Museum of Ceramics lists dozens of pottery companies that operated there. Pearl
                      Co. was designed to serve both as a pottery and as a distributor of goods from other
                      manufacturers. Pottery production stopped in 1960, but the company remained open as a popular
                      retail outlet until late summer 2009, switching owners to friends of the Singers a couple times
                      before the last owner retired. As far as I know this was the only cow mold (#635) that Pearl
                      used, and these were the only three colors in which they were produced. From the frequency with
                      which they appear on eBay, they were quite popular at one time. Pearl apparently did make some
                      for other locations or organizations to sell as souvenirs –a yellow one with a Pikes Peak picture
                      is shown on the Advertising and Souvenirs page. </p>

                  for Jim Beam decanters, the Old MacDonald Farm and Little Red Riding Hood series, and cookie jars; it
                  closed in June 1992. The orange clay milk carton with black hooves and shiny white spot came from a
                  fancy ceramic shop in the UK in 1996, and is marked with a handwritten “ii95, ©</p>

                  It’s marked for St. Michael, mold #2233. From Wikipedia I learned that the St Michael brand was
                  introduced in 1928 to designate quality items made by the firm of N. Corah &amp; Sons of Leicester
                  and sold through Marks &amp; Spenser. By 1950, Wikipedia notes, “virtually all goods in Marks &amp;
                  Spenser were sold under the St Michael brand”, which was used as a ‘quality guarantee’. In 2000,
                  Marks &amp; Spenser dropped the St Michael name in favor of their own brand.</p>

                  opened in 1977. The ‘about us’ section of their web sites states “For 30 years G.F. and Penny Cloud
                  have been making a wide variety of porcelain pottery. They have gathered together some of the most
                  talented ceramic artists in the country, and most importantly, they have given them the place, tools
                  and support to do the work they love and grow and prosper as artists. We make a promise to our
                  clients…and that is to be true to our inspiration and to bring the fruit of our labor to you at a
                  fair price and to never compromise our environmental standards, ethical standards or to falsely
                  represent what we do or can do.” They show pictures of some of their recent artists, but nothing
                  about Peter K. </p>

                  the latter. And I’m guessing that the Ron was for drinking, not pouring on the
                  ground. It nearly didn’t make it into the collection because it came with the
                  handle badly broken in shipping (thus the eBay seller refunded the price), as well
                  as a missing horn. Then I broke the other horn.&nbsp; But it was so unusual that I

                <p>The plain brown bull pitcher here is unmarked. It’s companion, which has
                  “VINO” embossed on its right side and a connected large T and small R on the left,
                  is apparently the same ceramic pitcher, but beautifully wrapped in varnished
                  goatskin parchment. The seller indicated that, although unmarked, it was most
                  likely attributed to Aldo Tura, an Italian artist-craftsman-designer who began his
                  furniture and decorative object business in the 1930’s (see www.tura.it). I’ve
                  poked around a bit and found that Tura did indeed make quite a number of
                  parchment-wrapped bar accessories as well as bars and other furniture, and some of
                  the accessories seem to have been marked with a green label stuck to the bottom,
                  which may have fallen off of this piece. If it is indeed a Tura then I got a heck
                  of a bargain…and if not, at least I’ve now got a really classy goatskin-parchment
                  wrapped vino jug.</p>
                <p>Update: Since I acquired the leather-wrapped bull I’ve seen several others on offer in various
                  conditions and with different brands. One, in pretty tough shape, had a label that read “Artesania
                  Raymon, Made in Spain, Ref 125”. I’ve not been able to find out anything about this company except
                  that it’s in Valencia, and has made a variety of other leather-wrapped glass and pottery items. I
                  think this attribution is more likely than Tura.</p>

                  doesn't make a lot of sense. . Perhaps it's some idiomatic saying that neither I nor google translate

                  understand the symbolism of the figures to its sides. I have no idea where the caricature on the
                  right came from, and am preetty surte that it's more devil than cow.</p>

                  doubts. It probably came with a cork and metal stopper in the snout. The attribution is
                  possibly to Orrefors Kosta Borda AB, a Swedish utility and art glass company that has a
                  history dating back to 1742 (and since 2005 has been part of the New Wave Group), but more
                  likely (from what I can find on the web) to John Erik Hugo Gehlin (1889-1953) a Swedish
                  glass artist and designer at Gulla Skrufs glassworks which was in production from 1893 to
                  1995 and was once owned by Orrefors. One way or the other, it for sure seems to be
