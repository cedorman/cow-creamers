          <h1>Places of Origin</h1>
          <p>Like most other things these days, many of ‘new’ cow creamers, pitchers, and teapots are “Made in
            China”, irrespective of the brand, designer, or importer/merchandiser.  For a while of course Japan had much the same market
            influence and a good many are still manufactured there, for companies from many countries.  Most of those Chinese and Japanese cows are scattered through the various  categories (e.g., Teapots, miniatures, Modern Variations) since the place of manufacture is not all
            that important.  However some  bear a unique flavor of Japan or China, and were either made for local use or bear no  attribution to a ‘foreign’ designer, so are featured here.</p>
			
          <p align="left">As with my other categories, this one is neither ‘pure’ nor complete.  I have put creamers
            that come from or are attributed to geographic areas (or types of clay or glaze) that are particularly prominent in my collection such as “Bennington”, “Staffordshire”, “Jackfield”, and “Delft” in their own
            separate categories. Some other country-specific creamers are shown under ‘Favorite Brands', e.g. Kent
            (England) or Schafer & Vater and Goebel (Germany).  Here I give examples of creamers (and a few teapots and suiteki)that seem to me to be characteristic of their country  or region.</p>

              <td colspan="2"><strong>England</strong>:While as noted on the history page cow creamers per se may have
                originated in Holland, their popularity and profusion really blossomed in England, first in London with silver ones, then from  the potteries in Staffordshire, so that England in many
                ways can claim to be ‘home’ to them.  My collection has hundreds of modern English cow creamers in addition to
                the silver and “Staffordshire” ones, and many of those come from potteries in and around the historic
                Staffordshire city of Stoke-on-Trent. As discussed on the Staffordshire page, this city comprises six
                distinct towns: Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton – which due to the predominance of
                this industry are collectively known as “The Potteries”. Indeed the Stoke-on-Trent website is
                www.thepotteries.org and in addition to some fascinating information about the area and its history, it
                has a wealth of information about English pottery in general and more specifically about the 1500 or so
                potters and their firms who have worked in the area since the early 1700s, plus a ‘features’ section
                that details the history of a number of them. Many of these firms have changed names, gone out of
                business, been bought or combined etc. over the course of the last three-plus centuries, and the
                consolidation and loss continue to this day. So, here are just a few examples, from early to modern.  Some  others are displayed on the Favorite
                Brands page, and many more and scattered through  the other themes.</td>

			<p> Upstairs-Downstairs:  If you have read a bit of my history page, or perhaps looked st the Silver cows, you'ld agree that it's only approproiate to recognize English cow creamers with one of my two silver ones by John Schuppe, dated 1764, accompanied  the more 'plebian' earthenware Staffordshire version here in the middle, which dates from the early 1800s..  It's also impoirtant to note that while the Staffordshire potteries have turned to making more modern versions of cow creamners as shown below, the traditional silver versions are still being made and many of them - like 'Dalina' here - bear a close resemblance to Schuppe's original (here only the front half of the cow...its hind quarters are the 'Dali' part). You can find more about Schuppe and Dalina on the Silver page and of course there is a separate page with a whole modest herd of 'Staffordahire' ones.</p></blockquote>

                  at his studio in North Cornwall. They are dated 1994 and  we bought the black and white one in a tea shop the year after that while in London. It is the guilty party that started the teapot part of my collection. The brown one is a bit more rare and it came along quite a bit later. Andy's work is lovely and unique, and  you can check it out on his web site at <a href="http://www.andytitcomb.com/">www.andytitcomb.com.

                <p>Here are three modern English versions that have each been produced by quite a few potteries. The one on the
                  left is marked for Burleigh ware, the middle one for Wood Potters of Burslem, and the big flow-blue one
                  for Royal Crownford. I have perhaps a half dozen or more of each mold, from different makers, but
                  these three each have their own story which is perhaps worth a short introduction here. </p>
                <p>One of the very few older firms still running under family (albeit a different family) ownership -
                  and in the same location at the Middleport Pottery since 1888 - is Burleigh Dorling & Leigh, now
                  trading as Burleigh, see www.bureleigh.co.uk. This firm began as Hulme & Booth in 1851, and in 1862
                  was taken over by William Leigh and Frederick Rathbone Burgess (thus Burgess and Leigh, thus
                  Burleigh). It came totally under the Leigh family in 1919. They built up an export network that
                  thrived until a ‘run of financial difficulty’ in 1999 led to the sale to the Dorling family, who now
                  run the business. The web site claims that they’re the last working Victorian pottery factory in
                  England. They pride themselves on their blue and white china, and note that they “use ball clay from
                  Devon; china clay from Cornwall and the unique skilled decorating process of underglaze transfer printing.” </p>
                <p>The potteries web site traces the history of various Woods enterprises. Their story begins in the
                  mid 1700s with three brothers – Ralph who’s best known for Toby Jugs, Aaron who was the finest mould
                  maker in Staffordshire, and Moses. Wood & Sons prospered under members of the family until the
                  recession of the late 1970’s, then under a receivership was acquired by the Yorke family in 1982.
                  Wood & Sons called in the receivers in 2005. Other Wood enterprises included that of Arthur whose
                  Bradwell Works in Longport operated from 1904 to 1928, and from then until 1989 traded as Arthur Wood
                  & Sons Ltd, when it was acquired by Price and Kensington. They are both now part of the Rayware
                  Group. Another Wood, Tony, a 9th generation direct descendant of Ralph, operated his Tony Wood Studios from 1980 till ~1991.</P>
				  <p>Royal Crownford is one of the trade names of J H Weatherby & Sons Ltd, whose firm was
                  founded in Tunstall in 1891 and moved to the Falcon Pottery in Hanley the following year, finally
                  closing in April 2000. Its other brands included J H W and Sons, Weatherby, and Falconware.</p>

			  <td><strong>Germany: </strong>  There are a number of very fine German porcelain and ceramics factories that
                have made some superb cow creamers, notably Goebel, Royal Bayreuth, and Schafer and Vater. These             
                figure prominently in my collection and are covered under Favorite Brands, with Royal Bayreuth also featured on the Heads page..  In addition,
                there seem to be quite a few other makers who have produced some lovely examples such as those shown
                here.  Many of these are porcelain and many of them have “Germany” and a mold number inscribed on the
                lower side of their belly, but few to none have a maker's mark.  In addition to those shown here, most of the
                nicer early ‘souvenir picture’ creamers in the Advertising and Souvenirs page are also of German
                manufacture.  Since there were so many active German potteries in the late 19c and early 20c, and since
                borders changed during those years, I have no way of knowing more precisely who made these or where.</td>

The little one in the middle is marked "sterling" and also bears a "B&Z" mark for the US importers, Bucholz & Zelt of New York.  It it typical of the small herd of 'single-serving' silver cow creamers in my collection, many of which are also German and several of which came through B&Z.  The little one on the right is one of serveral I have that comes from Hanau, famed not only for the number and quality of its silversmiths, but also for the use of "pseudo-marks' in defiance of the German assay office regulations. This one bears the mark of Johan Sigmund Kurz & Co., active from around 1848 until the 1960s. They were noted for working in the 'antique' style.  This cow came to me from Germany, so presumably it was initially sold and used locally. </p></td>

                <p><strong>Poland:</strong>  The center of Polish pottery is the city of Boleslawiec, ~120km
                  west of Warsaw, on the Bobr River in SW Poland near the German (Silesia)
                  border.  Pottery making in this area, which is renowned for its white clay,
                  dates back to around the 7c.  Boleslawiec is apparently sort of a Polish
                  version of Stoke-on-Trent in England or Rudolstadt in Germany (I haven't visited it [yet], so this is
                  just a guess); at any rate, it has a lot of pottery factories.  Brightly
                  decorated Polish dinnerware from this region seems to be extremely popular
                  in the US these days; some even showed up at an Alaskan Army base PX we
                  visited.   Using the web as a guide, I find that the cow on the left in the left hand picture,
                   is from Zaklad Ceramiki Artystycznej "TYRCZ", and the
                  one on the right is from Zaklad Ceramiczny Stanislaw "WIZA" which is in the
                  village of Parowa, about 13 km west of Boleslawiec. The smiley creamer in
                  the center of the left picture, and the one on the left of the right shot,
                  are most likely from Ceramika Szlachetna "DANA", which was established in
                  1975 and prides itself on continuing to use only traditional hand-made
                  techniques; thus each of their pieces is marked "UNIKAT", which means
                  unique.  The little smiley guys with the tiny round mouths are pretty
                  obviously from the same area, but I don't have their precise pedigree. To learn more about Polish

In the middle are other typical Spanish souvenir bull figures, sized variously for wine or to serve as cruets for oil and vinegar, and available in a wide range of colors and shapes.  More are shown on the Rhytons page. The one on the right  is an interesting interpretation from the Atelier  Domingo Punter e Hijos S.A, of Teruel in the eastern Aragon region of Spain. Their works' style and coloration  recreate the beauty of XIVc Spanish Romantic ceramics. This cow (or more likely bull) is also featuresd, with more information, in Rhytons. </p></blockquote>

My wife and I found a lot of these lovely creamers during a visit to Lisbon in November 1997; we came home with stuffed suitcases.  They are all handpainted, from several different factories. The second type is the more normal modern ceramic cow creamer like the one on the right here.

                <p> <strong>Peru</strong>: One of the most characteristic Peruvian pottery items is the Torito
                  De Pucara, or Little Bull of Pucara.  Pucara is located northwest of Lake
                  Titicaca, some 140 Km southeast of Cusco on the road to Puno and the Lake.
                  The town derives its name from the Pukara culture which flourished from
                  about 200BC to 800AD.  It has been a center of pottery manufacture for over
                  2 millennia, and remains the largest ceramics producing area in southern
                  Peru.  The Torito is a good example of the fusion of local Andean and
                  Spanish cultures: the bull is a typically Spanish symbol of strength and
                  courage, but it was adopted by Andean craftsmen in the later part of the 18c
                  (recall the Spanish conquered the Inca empire in the mid-16c).  Various web
                  sources state that the Torito originated as a ritual element for the
                  cattle-branding ceremony, as a flask to contain a mixture of chicha (a corn
                  based beer) and cattle blood, drunk by the priest conducting the ceremony.
                  These days, in addition to serving as a vase and a popular tourist item, a
                  pair of Toritos (for prosperity and fertility, since bulls now provide the
                  main power for plowing on most farms), often accompanied by a cross and two
                  bottles or jugs (one for holy water and one for chicha, again showing the
                  intermixture of cultures) is installed on the roof of houses.  Our local
                  guide stated that while the walls of farm homes are usually home-made from
                  dried mud, the roof tiles must be bought, and thus the completion of a
                  (costly) roof is a time for celebration, as well as the invocation of both
                  Catholic and indigenous protective forces for the home.  The same seems to
                  apply to this stone home with a thatch roof in Ollantaytambo, albeit here the
                  'bottles' are somewhat less than traditional.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, the Peruvian Ministry of External Commerce and Tourism (MINCETUR) together with a
                      number of business groups sponsored a traveling exhibition called "My Torito of Pucara" in which
                      40 featured artists decorated Toritos which were ultimately auctioned off to the public at the
                      National Museum to raise funds for handicraft training and technology. I missed that event, but I
                      believe I more than made up for it during an early-2008 visit to Peru by commissioning this 734
                      gram, .95 silver Torito do Pucara from the Arte Magico Andino Joyeria in Cusco. Virtually all the
                      artisans in their workshop turned to in order to produce this delightful, one of a kind (at least
                      as of now!) 'cow creamer' (yes, it does indeed have 2 holes!) in about 3 days so that I could carry
                      him home (and found, much to my delight, that he could enter the US duty-free!).</p>	</blockquote>

                  Lisbon, Portugal, where the dealer indicated it was made for the export trade @1880. Its base
                  markings are the ones on the right (third picture , and thanks to Paula
                  Airey of the Isle of Wight from whom I bought a more modern copy, I was led to the www.gotheborg.com
                  site of Jan-Erik Nilsson, a treasure house of information on Chinese and Japanese porcelain.
                  Comparing them to the sets of marks found there, they seem similar to those of PIN -
                  "Treasure/Product" or "Precious Product" mark #384, Qiang Yi Tong/Zhen Cang Pin "Qiang Yi Hall Precious Treasure". The
                  newer teapot with the heavier somewhat blurry  bears the marks (#114 or 767 in the gotheborg list) of Yi Qian Tang (factory
                  name) and Long Nian Zhi (Made in the year of the Dragon) and is likely from the 1980's. These
                  porcelain decoration factories used older blanks from China and Japan, and German enamels, and
                  specialize in products for 'expats'. I was very excited when I got my first one of these (albeit aghast at the shipping price from Lisbon), although I
                  have since seem quite a number on ebay, all of them seemingly modern versions. </p></blockquote>

			<p><strong> U.S.A.</strong>Since the northeastern portion of the US was settled by Brits, it was only natural for some enterprising potter to start producing cow creamers that bore at least a family resemnblance to those from Staffordshire.

Thus what is referred to as American Rockingham ware from the glaze, or Bennington from where they were made in Vermont starting in the late 18c or early 19c, will have to serve as examples of early American cow creamers.

There are a lot of pewterers in the US, dating from colonial times when pewter was a spatle of everyday life, at least for the more well-to-do settlers. As noted on www.colonialsense.com,  "Pewter made its appearance in Jamestown, Virginia by 1610...Pewter arrived in the New England area by the 1630s as newly arrived colonists brought pewter with them from their native England. In 1635, Richard Graves opened the first American pewter store in Salem Massachusetts. He supplied homes, taverns, and churches in the colonies with ladles, mugs, plates, bowls, and spoons. Although he was presented at a Quarterly Court on february 28, 1642-1643 for "opression in his trade of pewtering," he was acquitted of the charge. Along with Richard Graves, there were four other pewterers that were active in the Massachusetts Bay Colony by 1640..." and a whole lot of other neat information. So although these two cows are 21c, they are representative of a long and proud American tradition.</p></blockquote>

			<p>This is about as <strong>American</strong> as you can get - a Whirley Moo Cow Creamer, shown here in a set with a sugar dispenser. They were hugely popular in the 1970s, and millions were sold in roadside restaurants.  These days they are one of the most prolific cow items on Ebay. I just checked and found about 290 of them on offer. You can read a whole lot about them on the Advertising and Souvenirs page.</p></td>

			<p>This is another great American tradition - handmade items, or folk art. On the left are two examples of the lovely pottery from the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico.  Cows may not have been their favorite object to craft, but many potters did make some, and my small collection is at the bottom of Page 2 of Modern Variations.  On the right is just plain old 20c 'folk art', the bigger one by an unknown nmaker but bearing the words "Caro, Her Cow" inside, and the dark one by James C. Seagraves who was obviously very proud of his home town.  There is actually a third type of these 'hand done' cow creamers, namely those from places where folks rent a mold to make their item and then paint it however they like. My Father  made me a cow creamer at one of these places, and his and many others are on the Modern Variations pages.</p></blockquote>

			<p>My collection has  several hundred cow creamers, teapots, etc designed by American firms but made where manufacturing is cheap - Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, China... There are many fewer that are both deigned and made here.  Many of these, like the two on the left by Tom Hatton, are the products of master artist potters who take great pride in their originality and quality. I suppose one could almost call these 'high-end' folk art, and Anmericans excel at it. On the right are two that aren't quite as idiosyncratic but nevertheless are proudly American. The little kneeling guy is by Brad Keeler, and the lovely head by Coventry. There are a bunch of other made in the US examples in the collection, but again they are outnumbered by those designed here then imported.</p></blockquote>

                <p><strong>Canada:</strong> I have bought many creamers in and from Canada, but know of few that were
                  made there.  Here are three Canadian-made creamers from McMaster Pottery which was founded by
                  Ohio-born potter Harry McMaster and his son Robert in 1939 in Dundas, Ontario (it and other McMaster
                  enterprises are now part of the MMG Group). The dark brown one with red drippings in the glaze is
                  particularly interesting because it’s made from red clay, is a souvenir from Ft Macleod, Alberta
                  (just an hour’s drive eat of the Rockies), and still bears the red and gold “McMaster Craft” stamp on
                  its rump.</p>

                  certainly decorated there. They bear Ukranian decorations from (l) Ceramic Cottage Vegreville,
                  Alberta, and (rt) Diana May Clay, Ltd of Saskatchewan.</p>

                <p>From the seller and Wikipedia we learn that in 1950 21 year-old Dennis Tupy left his native
                  Czechoslovakia and heaed to Halifax. He ended up in Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. With the help of
                  Jozo Weider (a fellow Czech), founder of a ski resort on the slopes of Blue Mountain in Collingwood,
                  in the fall of 1953 he launched the Blue Mountain Pottery. Originally producing hand-painted ski
                  motifs on purchased blanks, production of red clay items like this creamer started in 1953-1954. They
                  went on to produce various types of pottery, from animal figurines to jugs, pots and vases.
                  Blue Mountain Pottery items feature a unique, trademarked glazing process known as "reflowing
                  decorating." Two different liquid glazes, one light and one dark in color, were applied. During the
                  firing process the glazes would run, creating streaking patterns unique to each piece. In 2004,
                  foreign competition and changing tastes led to Blue Mountain pottery's closure, although its pottery
                  is widely collected and has spawned a Collectors Club. This creamer celebrates Timmins, located in NE
                  Ontario, noted for its lumbering and mining industries.</p>
