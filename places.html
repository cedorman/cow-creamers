          <h1>Places of Origin</h1>
          <p>Like most other things these days, the majority of ‘new’ cow creamers, pitchers, and teapots are “Made in
            China”, irrespective of the brand or designer.  For a while of course Japan had much the same market
            influence and a good many are still manufactured there, for companies from many countries.  I’ve included
            most of those Chinese and Japanese items in the other categories since the place of manufacture is not all
            that important, albeit some of the ones that seem to bear a unique flavor of Japan or China, and bear no
            attribution to a ‘foreign’ designer, are included here.</p>
			
          <p align="left">As with my other categories, this one is neither ‘pure’ nor complete.  I have put creamers
            that come from or are attributed to geographic areas (or types of clay or glaze) that are particularly
            important for my collection such as “Bennington”, “Staffordshire”, “Jackfield”, and “Delft” in their own
            separate categories.  Some other country-specific creamers are covered under ‘favorite brands', e.g. Kent
            (England) or Schafer and Vater (Germany).   I have completely left the US out of this country-oriented
            compendium since I’ve integrated the American folk-art and US-manufactured ones into other parts of the
            collection. Here I try to give examples of creamers that seem to me to be characteristic of their country
            or region, or for which I have only a few.</p>

                <p><strong>Canada:</strong> I have bought many creamers in and from Canada, but know of few that were
                  made there.  Here are three Canadian-made creamers from McMaster Pottery which was founded by
                  Ohio-born potter Harry McMaster and his son Robert in 1939 in Dundas, Ontario (it and other McMaster
                  enterprises are now part of the MMG Group). The dark brown one with red drippings in the glaze is
                  particularly interesting because it’s made from red clay, is a souvenir from Ft Macleod, Alberta
                  (just an hour’s drive eat of the Rockies), and still bears the red and gold “McMaster Craft” stamp on
                  its rump.</p>

                <p>From the seller and Wikipedia we learn that n 1950 21 year-old Dennis Tupy left his native
                  Czechoslovakia and heaed to Halifax. He ended up in Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. With the help of
                  Jozo Weider (a fellow Czech), founder of a ski resort on the slopes of Blue Mountain in Collingwood,
                  in the fall of 1953 he launched the Blue Mountain Pottery. Originally producing hand-painted ski
                  motifs on purchased blanks, production of red clay items like this creamer started in 1953-1954. The
                  pottery went on to produce various types of pottery, from animal figurines to jugs, pots and vases.
                  Blue Mountain Pottery items feature a unique, trademarked glazing process known as "reflowing
                  decorating." Two different liquid glazes, one light and one dark in color, were applied. During the
                  firing process the glazes would run, creating streaking patterns unique to each piece. In 2004,
                  foreign competition and changing tastes led to Blue Mountain pottery's closure, although its pottery
                  is widely collected and has spawned a Collectors Club. This creamer celebrates Timmins, located in NE
                  Ontario, noted for its lumbering and mining industries.</p>

              <td colspan="2"><strong>England</strong>:While as noted on the history page cow creamers per se may have
                originated in Holland, their popularity and profusion really blossomed in England, so the UK in many
                ways can claim to be ‘home’ to them. My collection has hundreds of modern British ones in addition to
                the silver and “Staffordshire” ones, and many of those come from potteries in and around the historic
                Staffordshire city of Stoke-on-Trent. As noted in the Staffordshire section, this city comprises six
                distinct towns: Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton – which due to the predominance of
                this industry are collectively known as “The Potteries”. Indeed the Stoke-on-Trent website is
                www.thepotteries.org and in addition to some fascinating information about the area and its history,
                has a wealth of information about English pottery in general and more specifically about the 1500 or so
                potters and their firms who have worked in the area since the early 1700s, plus a ‘features’ section
                that details the history of a number of them. Many of these firms have changed names, gone out of
                business, been bought or combined, etc, over the course of the last three-plus centuries, and the
                consolidation and loss continue to this day. So, here are just a couple examples, of creamers from
                molds that have been used by many different potteries. Some more idiosyncratic ones are on the Favorite
                Brands page, and scattered through many of the other themes.</td>

                <p>Here are three different versions that have been produced by quite a few potteries. The one on the
                  left is marked for Burleigh ware, the middle one for Wood Potters of Burslem, and the big flow-blue one
                  for Royal Crownford. I have perhaps a half dozen or more of each mold, from different makers, but
                  these three each have their own story which is perhaps worth a short introduction here. </p>
                <p>One of the very few older firms still running under family (albeit a different family) ownership -
                  and in the same location at the Middleport Pottery since 1888 - is Burleigh Dorling & Leigh, now
                  trading as Burleigh, see www.bureleigh.co.uk. This firm began as Hulme & Booth in 1851, and in 1862
                  was taken over by William Leigh and Frederick Rathbone Burgess (thus Burgess and Leigh, thus
                  Burleigh). It came totally under the Leigh family in 1919. They build up an export network that
                  thrived until a ‘run of financial difficulty’ in 1999 led to the sale to the Dorling family, who now
                  run the business. The web site claims that they’re the last working Victorian pottery factory in
                  England. They pride themselves on their blue and white china, and note that they “use ball clay from
                  Devon; china clay from Cornwall and the unique skilled decorating process of underglaze transfer
                  printing.” Royal Crownford is one of the trade names of J H Weatherby & Sons Ltd, whose firm was
                  founded in Tunstall in 1891 and moved to the Falcon Pottery in Hanley the following year, finally
                  closing in April 2000. Its other brands included J H W and Sons, Weatherby, and Falconware.</p>
                <p>The potteries web site traces the history of various Woods enterprises. Their story begins in the
                  mid 1700s with three brothers – Ralph who’s best known for Toby Jugs, Aaron who was the finest mould
                  maker in Staffordshire, and Moses. Wood & Sons prospered under members of the family until the
                  recession of the late 1970’s, then under a receivership was acquired by the Yorke family in 1982.
                  Wood & Sons called in the receivers in 2005. Other Wood enterprises included that of Arthur whose
                  Bradwell Works in Longport operated from 1904 to 1928 and from then until 1989 traded as Arthur Wood
                  & Sons Ltd, when it was acquired by Price and Kensington. They are both now part of the Rayware
                  Group. Another Wood, Tony, a 9th generation direct descendent of Ralph, operated his Tony Wood
                  Studios from 1980 till ~1991.</P>

                have made some superb cow creamers - notably Goebel, Royal Bayreuth, and Schafer and Vater - which
                figure prominently in my collection and are covered under their own or other headings.  In addition,
                there seem to be quite a few other makers who have produced some lovely examples such as those shown
                here.  Many of these are porcelain and many of them have “Germany” and a mold number inscribed on the
                lower side of their belly, but none have a maker's mark.  In addition to those shown here, most of the
                nicer early ‘souvenir picture’ creamers in the Advertising and Souvenirs page are also of German
                manufacture.  Since there were so many active German potteries in the late 19c and early 20c, and since
                borders changed during those years, I have no way of knowing more precisely who made these or where.</td>

                <p><strong>Poland:</strong>  The center of Polish pottery is the city of Boleslawiec, ~120km
                  west of Warsaw, on the Bobr River in SW Poland near the German (Silesia)
                  border.  Pottery making in this area, which is renowned for its white clay,
                  dates back to around the 7c.  Boleslawiec is apparently sort of a Polish
                  version of Stoke-on-Trent in England (I haven't visited it [yet], so this is
                  just a guess); at any rate, it has a lot of pottery factories.  Brightly
                  decorated Polish dinnerware from this region seems to be extremely popular
                  in the US these days; some even showed up at an Alaskan Army base PX we
                  visited.   Using the web as a guide, I find that in the left hand picture,
                  the cow on the left is from Zaklad Ceramiki Artystycznej "TYRCZ", and the
                  one on the right is from Zaklad Ceramiczny Stanislaw "WIZA" which is in the
                  village of Parowa, about 13 km west of Boleslawiec. The smiley creamer in
                  the center of the left picture, and the one on the left of the right shot,
                  are most likely from Ceramika Szlachetna "DANA", which was established in
                  1975 and prides itself on continuing to use only traditional hand-made
                  techniques; thus each of their pieces is marked "UNIKAT", which means
                  unique.  The little smiley guys with the tiny round mouths are pretty
                  obviously from the same area, but I don't have their precise pedigree. To learn more about Polish

                    (and wine) than tea or ‘American’ coffee with cream.  There are however some very fine examples
                    about a third of the way down on page 3 of Modern Variations.</p>

                <p> <strong>Peru</strong>: One of the most characteristic modern Peruvian pottery items is the Torito<br>
                  De Pucara, or Little Bull of Pucara.  Pucara is located northwest of Lake<br>
                  Titicaca, some 140 Km southeast of Cusco on the road to Puno and the Lake.<br>
                  The town derives its name from the Pukara culture which flourished from<br>
                  about 200BC to 800AD.  It has been a center of pottery manufacture for over<br>
                  2 millennia, and remains the largest ceramics producing area in southern<br>
                  Peru.  The Torito is a good example of the fusion of local Andean and<br>
                  Spanish cultures: the bull is a typically Spanish symbol of strength and<br>
                  courage, but it was adopted by Andean craftsmen in the later part of the 18c<br>
                  (recall the Spanish conquered the Inca empire in the mid-16c).  Various web<br>
                  sources state that the Torito originated as a ritual element for the<br>
                  cattle-branding ceremony, as a flask to contain a mixture of chicha (a corn<br>
                  based beer) and cattle blood, drunk by the priest conducting the ceremony.<br>
                  These days, in addition to serving as a vase and a popular tourist item, a<br>
                  pair of Toritos (for prosperity and fertility, since bulls now provide the<br>
                  main power for plowing on most farms), often accompanied by a cross and two<br>
                  bottles (one for holy water and one for chicha, again showing the<br>
                  intermixture of cultures) is installed on the roof of houses.  Our local<br>
                  guide stated that while the walls of farm homes are usually home-made from<br>
                  dried mud, the roof tiles must be bought, and thus the completion of a<br>
                  (costly) roof is a time for celebration, as well as the invocation of both<br>
                  Catholic and indigenous protective forces for the home.  The same seems to<br>
                  apply to this stone home with a thatch roof in Ollantaytambo, albeit here the<br>
                  'bottles' are somewhat less than traditional.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, the Peruvian Ministry of External Commerce and Tourism (MINCETUR) together with a
                      number of business groups sponsored a traveling exhibition called "My Torito of Pucara" in which
                      40 featured artists decorated Toritos which were ultimately auctioned off to the public at the
                      National Museum to raise funds for handicraft training and technology. I missed that event, but I
                      believe I more than made up for it during an early-2008 visit to Peru by commissioning this 734
                      gram, .95 silver Torito do Pucara from the Arte Magico Andino Joyeria in Cusco. Virtually all the
                      artisans in their workshop turned to in order to produce this delightful, one of a kind (at least
                      as of now!) 'cow creamer' (yes, it does indeed have 2 holes!) in about 3 days so I could carry
                      him home (and found, much to my delight, that he could enter the US duty-free!).</p?>

                <p><strong>China: </strong>I bought the creamer (or, rather, teapot) on the left in an antique store in
                  Lisbon, Portugal, where the dealer indicated it was made for the export trade @1880. Its base
                  markings are the ones on the right in the second picture (my inventory #207), and thanks to Paula
                  Airey of the Isle of Wight from whom I bought a more modern copy, I was led to the www.gotheborg.com
                  site of Jan-Erik Nilsson, a treasure house of information on Chinese and Japanese porcelain.
                  Comparing them to the sets of marks found there, they seem similar to those of PIN -
                  "Treasure/Product" mark #384, Qiang Yi Tong/Zhen Cang Pin "Qiang Yi Hall Precious Treasure". The
                  newer teapot (my #237) bears the marks (#114 or 767 in the gotheborg list) of Yi Qian Tang (factory
                  name) and Long Nian Zhi (Made in the year of the Dragon) and is likely from the 1980's. These
                  porcelain decoration factories used older blanks from China and Japan, and German enamels, and
                  specialize in products for 'expats'. Although I was very exciited when I got my first one of these, I
                  have since seem quite a number on ebay, albeit all of them are modern versions. </p>
