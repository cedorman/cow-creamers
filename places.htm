        <h1 align="left"><a id="h1"></a>Places of Origin</h1>
        <p>Like most other things these days, the majority of ‘new’ cow  creamers, pitchers, and teapots are “Made in China”, irrespective of the brand  or designer.  For a while of course Japan had much  the same market influence, and a good many are still manufactured there, for  companies from many countries.  I’ve  included most of those Chinese and Japanese items in the other categories since  the place of manufacture is not all that important, albeit some of the ones  that seem to bear a unique flavor of Japan or China, and bear no attribution to a  ‘foreign’ designer, are included here.</p>
        <p align="left">As with my other categories, this one is neither ‘pure’ nor  complete.  I have put creamers that come  from or are attributed to geographic areas (or types of clay or glaze) that are  particularly important for my collection such as “Bennington”, “Staffordshire”,  “Jackfield”, and “Delft” in their own separate categories.  Some other country-specific creamers are  covered under ‘factories’, e.g. Kent  (England)  or Schafer and Vater (Germany).   I have completely left the US out of this  country-oriented compendium since I’ve integrated the American folk-art and  US-manufactured ones into other parts of the collection. Here I try to give  examples of creamers that seem to me to be characteristic of their country or  region, or for which I have only a few.</p>

The dark brown one  with red drippings in the glaze is particularly interesting because it’s made  from red clay, is a souvenir from Ft Macleod, Alberta (just an hour’s drive eat  of the Rockies), and still bears the red and gold “McMaster Craft” stamp on its  rump.</p></td>

                <td colspan="2"><strong>England</strong>:While as noted on the history page cow creamers per se may have originated in Holland, their popularity and profusion really blossomed in England, so the UK in many ways can claim to be ‘home’ to them. My collection has hundreds of modern British ones in addition to the silver and “Staffordshire” ones, and many of those come from potteries in and around the historic Staffordshire city of Stoke-on-Trent.  As noted in the Staffordshire section, this city comprises six distinct towns: Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton – which due to the predominance of this industry are collectively known as “The Potteries”.  Indeed the Stoke-on-Trent website is www.thepotteries.org and in addition to some fascinating information about the area and its history, has a wealth of information about English pottery in general and more specifically about the 1500 or so potters and their firms who have worked in the area since the early 1700s, plus a ‘features’ section that details the history of a number of them.    Many of these firms have changed names, gone out of business, been bought or combined, etc, over the course of the last three-plus centuries, and the consolidation and loss continue to this day.  So, here are just a couple examples, of creamers from molds that have been used by many different potteries.  Some more idiosyncratic ones are on the Favorite Brands page, and scattered through many of the other themes.</td>

                <td valign="top"><p>Here are three different versions that have been produced by quite a few potteries.  The one on the left is marked for Burleigh ware, the middle for Wood Potters of Burslem, and the big flow-blue one for Royal Crownford. I have perhaps a half dozen or more of each mold, from different makers, but these three each have their own story which is perhaps worth a short introduction here. </p>
			<p>One of the very few older firms still running under family (albeit a different family) ownership  - and in the same location at the Middleport Pottery since 1888 - is Burleigh Dorling & Leigh, now trading as Burleigh, see www.bureleigh.co.uk.  This firm began as Hulme & Booth in 1851, and in 1862 was taken over by William Leigh and Frederick Rathbone Burgess (thus Burgess and Leigh, thus Burleigh). It came totally under the Leigh family in 1919.  They build up an export network that thrived until a ‘run of financial difficulty’ in 1999 led to the sale to the Dorling family, who now run the business.  The web site claims that they’re the last working Victorian pottery factory in England.  They pride themselves on their blue and white china, and note that they “use ball clay from Devon; china clay from Cornwall and the unique skilled decorating process of underglaze transfer printing.”  Royal Crownford is one of the trade names of J H Weatherby & Sons Ltd, whose firm was founded in Tunstall in 1891 and moved to the Falcon Pottery in Hanley the following year, finally closing  in April 2000.  Its other brands included J H W and Sons, Weatherby, and Falconware.</p>
			<p>The potteries web site traces the history of various Woods enterprises. Their story begins in the mid 1700s with three brothers – Ralph who’s best known for Toby Jugs, Aaron who was the finest mould maker in Staffordshire, and Moses. Wood & Sons prospered under members of the family until the recession of the late 1970’s, then under a receivership was acquired by the Yorke family in 1982.  Wood & Sons called in the receivers in 2005. Other Wood enterprises included that of Arthur whose Bradwell Works in Longport operated from 1904 to 1928 and from then until 1989 traded as Arthur Wood & Sons Ltd, when it was acquired by Price and Kensington. They are both now part of the Rayware Group.  Another Wood, Tony, a 9th generation direct descendent of Ralph, operated his Tony Wood Studios from 1980 till ~1991.</P></td>

                <p><strong>Poland:</strong>  The center of Polish pottery is the city of Boleslawiec, ~120km
                  west   of Warsaw, on the Bobr River in SW Poland near the German (Silesia)
                  border.    Pottery making in this area, which is renowned for its white clay,
                  dates back   to around the 7c.  Boleslawiec is apparently sort of a Polish
                  version of   Stoke-on-Trent in England (I haven't visited it [yet], so this is
                  just a   guess); at any rate, it has a lot of pottery factories.  Brightly
                  decorated   Polish dinnerware from this region seems to be extremely popular
                  in the US   these days; some even showed up at an Alaskan Army base PX we
                  visited.     Using the web as a guide, I find that in the left hand picture,
                  the cow on   the left is from Zaklad Ceramiki Artystycznej "TYRCZ", and the
                  one on the   right is from Zaklad Ceramiczny Stanislaw "WIZA" which is in the
                  village of   Parowa, about 13 km west of Boleslawiec. The smiley creamer in
                  the center of   the left picture, and the one on the left of the right shot,
                  are most likely   from Ceramika Szlachetna "DANA", which was established in
                  1975 and prides   itself on continuing to use only traditional hand-made
                  techniques; thus each   of their pieces is marked "UNIKAT", which means
                  unique.  The little smiley   guys with the tiny round mouths are pretty
                  obviously from the same area, but   I don't have their precise pedigree.

                  De Pucara, or Little Bull of   Pucara.  Pucara is located northwest of Lake<BR>
                  Titicaca, some 140 Km southeast   of Cusco on the road to Puno and the Lake.<BR>
                  The town derives its name from the   Pukara culture which flourished from<BR>
                  about 200BC to 800AD.  It has been a   center of pottery manufacture for over<BR>
                  2 millennia, and remains the largest   ceramics producing area in southern<BR>
                  Peru.  The Torito is a good example of   the fusion of local Andean and<BR>
                  Spanish cultures: the bull is a typically   Spanish symbol of strength and<BR>
                  courage, but it was adopted by Andean   craftsmen in the later part of the 18c<BR>
                  (recall the Spanish conquered the Inca   empire in the mid-16c).  Various web<BR>
                  sources state that the Torito originated   as a ritual element for the<BR>
                  cattle-branding ceremony, as a flask to contain a   mixture of chicha (a corn<BR>
                  based beer) and cattle blood, drunk by the priest   conducting the ceremony.<BR>
                  These days, in addition to serving as a vase and a   popular tourist item, a<BR>
                  pair of Toritos (for prosperity and fertility, since   bulls now provide the<BR>
                  main power for plowing on most farms), often   accompanied by a cross and two<BR>
                  bottles (one for holy water and one for   chicha, again showing the<BR>
                  intermixture of cultures) is installed on the roof   of houses.  Our local<BR>
                  guide stated that while the walls of farm homes are   usually home-made from<BR>
                  dried mud, the roof tiles must be bought, and thus the   completion of a<BR>
                  (costly) roof is a time for celebration, as well as the   invocation of both<BR>
                  Catholic and indigenous protective forces for the home.    The same seems to<BR>
                  apply to this stone home with a thatch roof in Ollantaytambo,   albeit here the<BR>
			'bottles' are somewhat less than   traditional.</p></td>

                <p><strong>China: </strong>I bought the creamer (or, rather, teapot) on the left in an  antique store in Lisbon, Portugal, where the dealer indicated it was   made  for the export trade @1880. Its base markings are the ones on the right   in  the second picture (my inventory #207), and thanks to Paula Airey of   the  Isle of Wight from whom I bought a more modern copy, I was led to the  www.gotheborg.com site of Jan-Erik Nilsson, a treasure house of   information  on Chinese and Japanese porcelain.  Comparing them to the sets of marks  found there, they seem similar to those of PIN - "Treasure/Product"   mark  #384, Qiang Yi Tong/Zhen Cang Pin "Qiang Yi Hall Precious Treasure".    The  newer teapot (my #237) bears the marks (#114 or 767  in the gotheborg   list)  of Yi Qian Tang (factory name) and Long Nian Zhi (Made in the year of   the  Dragon) and is likely from the 1980's. These porcelain decoration   factories  used older blanks from China and Japan, and German enamels, and   specialize  in products for 'expats'. Although I was very exciited when I got my first one of these, I have since seem quite a number on ebay, albeit all of them are modern versions. </p>                  </td>
