                    in brown and stamped 'Japan'.  Its features are really much the same -   big
                    nose, smile, and all - but it has a much larger back opening, a   heavier
                    chest, and a differently shaped bell.</p></td>

                      his mom bringing this out to serve the cream in when they had   company. That
                      was in the early 1950's, so this creamer is at least 50 years   old. It's been
                      in storage since they moved off the farm in the late 50's".    For some reason
                      there was a lot of competition for this one on eBay, while I   was the only
                      bidder on the brown one.  The Japanese seem also to have made a   smaller
                      version, with similar facial features though a bit of a different   body
                      shape.  Clever and entrepreneurial folks, those post-WWII   Japanese

                    Skipping over to the European  continent … here are some more (in addition to those in Places) Portuguese cow  creamers.  These two fancy ones are hand  painted in faience style. Written on the bottom of the larger one is “515, Berardos,  Made in Portugal,  Handpainted, SECXVIII, MY”.  Ceramica  Berardos is one of 9 independent ceramics factories in Condeixa, Coimbra. The writing on  the smaller one reads “117, Ceramica Conimbriga, Sec XVII, Hand Painted  Portugal, Lena”.  From the website Portugal Ceramica, we learn  that “Recovering a vanishing tradition, Cerâmica de Conímbriga settled in  Condeixa-a-Nova in 1960, converting this small town in the centre of Coimbra's traditional  Portuguese ceramic. Through the hand of the artist who conceived it, Vaz  Lameiro, the art of hispano-arabic ceramic and traditional Portuguese faience  (15th through 19th centuries) was developed, creating a prestigious name and  establishing itself as a school.”  From  Portugal2U, we further find that “The Pieces are reproductions of the  Decorations of the 15th and 17th Centuries faiences …This ceramic it’s the  only in Portugal,  that represents the east tradition, and mainly the influence of Chinese and  Arab style. .. Carlos Tomas the artist behind this factory, iniciated its activity as a  painter at 11 y.old in the famous and extinct &quot;Ceramica de Conimbriga&quot;,  and maintains not only the quality this factory was famous for, as well as the  Moulds that are unique to that Fabric, being able to reproduce identical pieces  to those ones!” </p></td>

                  <p>I hadn’t realized  that ESTE made these in more than one size until this lovely one, same shape  but distinctly smaller, joined the herd.   It inspired me to go back to the web and do a bit more digging, where  from Walter Del Pellegrino writing in http://italianpotterymarks.freeforums.org/post160.html  I found that “The factory &quot;Este Pottery and Porcelain&quot; was founded in  1893 by the merger Brunello di Giovanni Battista with the factory of Varion  Franchini, both active since the mid 18th century, with the same type of  production based on pottery tableware, figurines and monumental centerpieces .  Este porcelain established itself as an internationally important porcelain  firm in 1956 when Giovanni Giorgini Battista re-opened the factory after the  end of World War II. The factory is located in the same building occupied by  the original 'Este Ceramiche Porcellane' created in 1753, thus making Este one  of the oldest ceramics factories still in use in the world. Today, the factory  is owned by Giorgini's grandson, Giovanni Battista Fadigati.  Este's products are found in exclusive,  high-end stores around the world but the majority of its export ends up the  U.S. The Este mark shown [here, on my cow] dates the piece from the late 1950's  through the 1960's”.  For yet more information,  I can recommend V.O.W. No36 on www.yatzer.com, where there is a nice write-up  and also a really neat movie about the factory and its products.</p></td>

It was added to the confederation in the 15th  century. Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250&nbsp;years.  Like its neighbour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate" title="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>, it has been a traditional holiday destination for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">Londoners</a> drawn to  its sandy beaches. Margate had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> pier which was largely destroyed by a storm in 1978. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southend-on-Sea" title="Southend-on-Sea">Southend</a>, Margate was infamous for gang violence between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mods_and_rockers" title="Mods and rockers">mods and rockers</a> in the 1960s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(subculture)" title="Mod (subculture)">mods</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinheads" title="Skinheads">skinheads</a> in the 1980s.”  Further searching took me  to <a href="http://www.kentresources.co.uk/">www.kentresources.co.uk</a> where  I learned that the memorial relates to a local surf boat tragedy of December 2,  1897, in which 9 men lost their lives while joining an R.N.L.I. lifeboat in an  effort to help rescue passengers from a ship that had gone aground on the Margate  Sands after a collision.  Margate  lifeboat crews  much later won praise for  their heroic efforts ferrying British and French  troops from the beaches of Dunkirk during the  1940 evacuation.</p></td>

                <td><p>Here are three lovely East German porcelain  creamers. I had trouble identifying the maker’s marks until I got the lying  down cow that says “Made in GDR”; the other standing cows somewhat misleadingly  read “Dresden China, Germany”. Thanks to PM&amp;M (<a href="http://www.porcelainmarksandmore.com/">www.porcelainmarksandmore.com</a>)  I learned a bit of their history. The mark indicates that they were made by  Porzellanfabrik Friedrich Eger &amp; Co. which is in the village of Martinroda  (part of the town of Vacha  since the end of 2013) in Thuringia,   Germany.  This company was founded in 1901, reached its  peak ~1930, had to stop production shortly after the start of WWII, and then  restarted in 1946.  Thuringia  became party of Communist East Germany – the German Democratic Republic, GDR –  in 1949, but the factory remained privately owned until 1972. At that time it  was nationalized and renamed V.E.B. Porzellanwerk Martinroda as part of the  V.E.B. Zierporzellan Lichte combinate. Production was stopped in 1977 when the  factory was changed into a V.E.B.decoration division. After German  reunification in 1990 it took back its original name and struggled to get back into  the market.  Since my standing cows read  “Germany”  not “GDR” I believe they were made prior to nationalization, i.e. sometime  before 1972, and that their lying down cousin was produced after  nationalization.   The term “Dresden  China” was confusing since Dresden  is in Saxony, much further to the east.  A couple sites (including gaulartifact.com)  however have pointed out that Dresden China, or Dresden Porcelain, refers less  to the city and more to an ‘artistic movement’ and the use of ‘white gold’ or  hard paste porcelain, the recipe for which – previously the exclusive knowledge  of the Chinese -   was discovered in  Dresden during the reign of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, around  1708. Once the recipe was known quite a number of porcelain manufactories grew  up in the area, most notably Meissen,  and apparently the art and the name of the material carried  over into neighboring Thuringia. </p></td>

The factory was rebuilt on the site of two previous  potteries &quot;Tuppak&quot; and &quot;Silesia&quot;. Initially it was a very  small concern with few employees and few small electric kilns. The pottery  flourished due to careful attention to design, both in body shapes and  patterns. The manufacturing process was also improved, new kilns and better  clays plus more attention to detail. All this achieved results both at home in  Poland and abroad. At present Wiza employs about 120 people.”  To learn more about Polish pottery from a  number of factories, as well as other Polish handicrafts, try kaya.com.pl</p></td>

Since they say “Made in” (a common practice in many  countries it seems, they were pretty obviously made for the export trade.  With the exception of the large bull pitcher  and the one with polka dots (stamped simply “Made in Czechoslovakia” with no circle),  they seem to be fairly common and are frequently on offer on eBay.   Interestingly, I haven’t found any purely  ‘Czech’ or ‘Slovak’ cows from after the peaceful dissolution of the two  countries on 1 January 1993.  Since Czechoslovakia didn’t exist as a  sovereign nation until October 1918,  and  was partially incorporated into Nazi Germany from 1939-1945 and then came under  Communist control until 1990, I’d have to guess that these creamers date from sometime  in the 20s or 30s…which also makes sense since creamers of this sort were  popular during that period. <br>

                    This is an interesting pair of Japanese luster  creamers.  I believe they’re from the  same mold, albeit the horns of the yellowish one have been set at a different  angle.  The marks are different – the  purple one has two concentric circles with a 5-petaled flower in the middle and  “Made in Japan”  between.  I haven’t been able to identify  it, but pretty obviously the piece was made for export.  Thanks to Jan-Erik Nilsson’s wonderful <a href="http://www.gotheborg.com/">www.gotheborg.com</a> site (which I’ve  referred to elsewhere for help with my Chinese teapots), I have been able to  identify the red elephant head mark on the yellow cow as indicating Tashiro  Shoten of Yokohama.  “Shoten” indicates a  shop that sells products from its own kiln; this one was active from the  1930’s, from when this mark dates, till it closed in 1954.</p></td>

                    This  large gold creamer with the Chinese decorations has a sticker which says  “Designed and painted in Hong Kong by Maitland  Smith”. From eBay’s Popular Items selection, I found that “In 1979, a prominent  London antiques  dealer and designer [Paul Maitland-Smith] founded the company in Hong Kong. It reproduced eighteenth century decorative  accessories and furniture. Highly-skilled artisans and quality raw materials  were easily available to produce fine vintage furniture and accessories. The  company shifted to Philippines  in 1981 and started the first wholly-owned manufacturing facility. This  facilitated greater emphasis over quality and a wider product offering. Later,  a new facility was built in Indonesia  in the early 1990s to further expand its in-house designing and manufacturing  processes.” Digging further, from a 1996 Securities and Exchange Commission  10-K filing, we find that Maitland-Smith Inc. has a number of Asia  holdings, but was itself (along with many others) a subsidiary of  Lifestyle Furnishings International,  Ltd.  They in turn started divesting  themselves of furniture companies in 2002, and now Maitland-Smith is one of the  brands of Furniture Brands International, Inc., which according to their web  site is “the largest furniture manufacturer in the United States (and) was once  the largest footwear manufacturer in the United States called the International  Shoe Company.” It also has an intriguing history, starting in 1898, which can  be found on its web site.

                    Holes in their head…they must be…?? Only one is marked, and  it’s too faded to read. Both came from the UK via eBay, and one of the sellers  said he thought his cow was from Beddgelert Pottery (established 1962 and  operated by Mrs A, Davey and Mrs P Hancock) which is in Beddgelert, Snowdonia, Wales.  Following the web to Beddgelert’s tourism  site, we find an interesting (to me) story, about the village’s most famous  historical, feature, “Gelbert’s Grave”.   To quote the site, the headstone reads &quot;In the 13th century Llywelyn, prince of North   Wales, had a palace at Beddgelert. One day he went hunting without  Gelert, &quot;The Faithful Hound&quot;, who was unaccountably absent. On  Llywelyn's return the truant, stained and smeared with blood, joyfully sprang  to meet his master. The prince alarmed hastened to find his son, and saw the  infant's cot empty, the bedclothes and floor covered with blood. The frantic  father plunged his sword into the hounds side, thinking it had killed his heir.  The dog's dying yell was answered by a child's cry. Llywelyn searched and  discovered his boy unharmed, but near by lay the body of a mighty wolf which  Gelert had slain. The prince filled with remorse is said never to have smiled  again. He buried Gelert here.”  Following  these leads is one of the things I enjoy about my collection (even if they’re wrong – I have seen others like these advertised on eBay with a stamp for a different factory in Wales).</p>

I have seen one like it in the  Rice collection at Taylor   University – and although  larger at 6 ½” tall, it was considerably less expensive.  Then I managed to acquire the middle-sized  one in the blue robe – as a still lower price.   I’m wondering how many more versions there may be, and if the price will  keep dropping. </p></td>

                  <p>Here is one more of the Whirley Moo-cows, shown for  comparison with this other plastic cow with a yellow head.  Its base is very similar to the Whirley ones,  although the legs are depicted differently on the sides, the handle is  different, the front plaque is blank, and there is no mark on the bottom.  The head is very different, and actually sort  of cute.  It’s the only one of its kind I  have ever seen, and I bought it because I initially thought that it might have  been a version that was designed by Whirley Chief Engineer John Downey before  he came up with the one that they actually manufactured.  It would make sense that they tried out a few  variants before settling on one to mass produce.  So I wrote and asked the company’s founder and  apparently my guess was wrong because he assured me it was just a  knock-off.  I still like my story better  even if it is wrong!</p></td>

In this case, the ‘copy’ has a somewhat  narrower bottom, the head is quite different and sports a bow tie, and it’s  simply molded in two pieces rather than the several that make up the Whirley  version. In addition the head has interlocking tabs to connect to the body,  instead of the simple fit of the original.   As the Whirley founder said of the one above, ‘we sold 10 million and  they didn’t sell any!”  Nevertheless,  it’s sort of fun to discover the imitations. </p></td>

Milky would  drink the water, then her head would come up and she’d ‘moo’.  Next you  put the bucket under the appropriate part of Milky’s anatomy, pulled on  the plastic teat, and cloudy (from a powdered milk substance that came  as tablets) water would come out. Neat!

                    and Rose Michtom after they had invented the Teddy bear in  1903. The company
                    changed its name to Ideal Toy Company in 1938. In 1982, the  company was sold to CBS
                    Toy Company, which itself closed down. Certain brands and  toys have been continued

                  <p>In  addition to huge Milky, there are some tiny plastic milking toys.  I  have three versions of these.  First is “Jersey Jessie the Milking  Moo-Cow”.  Jessie was made by Thomas Toy. The placard around her neck  says, “Lift my tail and I’ll fill the pail”.  Jessie is a lot simpler  mechanically than Milky – you simply rotate her udder, remove it, fill  the little rubber bulb above it with water or milk, and put it back in;  lifting the tail compresses the bulb and presto!  In the second  picture, the little black cow standing tail to tail with Jessie is very  similar, albeit the neck is longer and the buckle on her collar is on  the opposite side.  Her side imprint reads “<span id="lw_1229745044_14">Tudor Rose</span>”, and on the other side, “Made in England”.   This company also made ramp walking cows that had the same body and  head shape.  Other than that, I haven’t been able to find out anything  about these little guys – not even who copied whom. In the third  picture, the little brown and white cow with the curved horns and black  bell operates the same way, but is obviously from a different mold.  I  have no information about that one.</p>              </td>

                    Same idea, different approach:  This old and much-loved cow is rubber; you  squeeze her sides, stick the nose in water, release and she fills up.  Then there’s a little detent on a spring in  the middle of her udder that you depress to have the liquid come out the other  end.  I have no information about this  one – it isn’t marked, but it’s certainly been well used since the fuzz is  completely rubbed off the side where you’d squeeze her.

                    Pewter is tin and lead, so it’s not exactly the best  material for storing liquids. Thus the pewter cow with the lid is lined with  silver plate.  It’s “Old Colony Pewter  Ware” and bears their name and mark of a lady in a bonnet inside the lid.  Its companion is Japanese, and appears to be  silverplate on the outside, with some sort of a white enamel coating inside.  The little guy in the pen with the bucket is  pewter pure and simple; it’s made by Universal Pewter and bears their mark of  an intertwined U and P in a circle, and is stamped to be 95% tin. A search on  the web shows that it’s available from Pierre Deux for $38 (they imply it’s  French Country of course), or from Shirley Pewter Shops of Williamburg VA for  $74 (they say it’s imported). About the only thing I can find out about  Universal Pewter Corporation through Google is that they were in Houston, TX  (of course that doesn’t say where their items were made), and that there have  recently been a couple of tax confiscation auctions of their properties.</p></td>

Line 2,  Pifuko, is in Hiragana, a more complex  alphabet usually used for native words.  I get Pifuko is the company, or Pifu,  and the first line is a small note.  Nifty cow, I think she's cute =)”   Many thanks for the help!</p></td>

                <td><p>Here is another with a hole in the butt that was  sufficiently unusual and inexpensive that it snuck into the collection. It was  sold as possibly Zanesville Frankoma art pottery – which is unclear since (from  Kovels.com) I learned that “Frankoma Pottery was originally known as The Frank  Potteries when John F. Frank opened shop in 1933. The factory opened in Ada, Oklahoma,  then moved to Sapulpa, Oklahoma in 1938… John Frank died in 1973  and his daughter, Joniece, inherited the business. After financial problems,  Frankoma was sold in 1991. The pottery operated under various owners for a few  years and was bought by Joe Ragosta in 2008. It closed in 2010. The buildings,  assets, name, and molds were sold at auction in 2011.” On the other hand from  morethanmccoy.com, another good source of information, we find that “Zanesville  Stoneware Company, (ZSC), Zanesville,   Ohio. In business from 1887-2002.  … this company did not like to mark their pottery because imported pottery had  to be marked with the country of origin, therefore, Zanesville felt it was not necessary to mark  their pottery since it was American made.” Well, at least I learned something  from it.</p></td>

                <td><p>Snookered twice, I guess.  I bought these some 11 years apart, having  forgotten about the first one (white) when I bought the second. Both were sold  as creamers, but on close inspection they have no hole in the face.  The back hole is quite large however, so I  suppose that they could be used as pitchers.   The seller of the black one contended that they were rare and were from  SylvaC, which I have learned from Wikipedia was founded in 1894 by William  Copestake and William Shaw, and “is  a brand of British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_(architecture)" title="Ornament (architecture)">ornamental</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a> characterised primarily by figurines of animals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Jugs" title="Toby Jugs">Toby Jugs</a>.  The SylvaC company briefly ceased production in 1982 although production of  SylvaC pieces was resumed in 1998 by the current trademark holder Norman  Williams.”  The article states that they  are neither rare nor high art but are ‘collectible’.  There is an extensive catalog of their pieces  for those who may be interested.  These  cows bear the number ‘66’ in an interesting spot – the back of their udder, between  the hind legs.  Whether they are actually  SylvaC or not I really don’t know, but in spite of their deficiencies from my  collection’s standpoint they are quite interesting. </p></td>

                    I’m closing out this theme section with a number of creamers  from Cow Parade. Cow Parade bills itself as ‘the world’s largest public art  event’.  The concept originated in Zurich in 1998, and the  first show was in Chicago  in 1999.  There have since been shows in some  40 cities around the world, and it has spurred a number of public art events  featuring other animals, e.g  bears,  horses, and fish, as well as a whole line of  figurines featuring some of the wilder designs.   At one point the company that produces the figurines made a number of  creamers and sugar-and-creamer sets from some of the ‘simpler’ designs.  These are all from the same molds, but bear  the decorations associated with their names.   There are also teapot versions of these two, Fruits of Summer and  Where’s the Beef.  I’d imagine that  somewhere there’s a record of the name of the artist that did each cow, plus  information on where the full size one was located, but I haven’t found it.</p></td>
