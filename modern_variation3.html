                  We begin this page with cow creamers from <strong>England.</strong> Here’s a 2007
                  version of an Emma Bridgewater cow creamer in the Holly and Ivy pattern. There's
                  also one on the Favorite Brands page. Emma's web web site says they started in
                  1985 when Emma was looking for a present for her mum, couldn't find the sort of
                  'warm and welcoming' china that she wanted, so decided to do it herself though
                  didn't know how.  She was pointed to Stoke-on-Trent by a friend, and although the
                  site gives no specifics, she apparently found someone who could help and started
                  her factory on Lichfild St in Hanley, at a site first opened by the Meakin
                  Broithers in 1883. She has certainly been successful - while many others were
                  closing or being acquired, Emma Bridgewater has thrived and claims to make 1.7
                  million pieces of pottery a year.  She also peddles a bunch of other stuff, and
                  now even has a US outlet and web site.    Theres's only this one style of cow creamer,  though they come in a
                  bunch of different designs. </p>

                <p>Here is another cow creamers in the series, the Black Toast (stamped “Toast and Marmalade”). Like the ivy pattern cow above and some of the others below, her cow creamers typically have lids but no bases.  As I noted on the Brands page, I fail to understand why Emma makes cow creamers that are unusable for food, especially she
                  charges as much for them as she does. Nobody else seems to have that penchant. I presume one can eat from Emma's plates, but for some reason she seems to think think these  cows are
                  just for decoration. </p>  </blockquote> </td>

			<p>It addition to the 'run of the mill' cow creamers (and presumably other pieces as well), Emma produces (according to the sellers) one-of-a-kind versions for the Emma Bridgewater Collectors Club. Here are Kitchen Garden and Men at Work (the 2008 version; it's my only cow that has trucks all over it). Interestingly they don't tll you not to use them, but then I'd expect that 'Collectors' have non-utilitarian interests. The belly shots show another peculiarity of Emma's cows - they have very distended stomachs. Overly fed one presumes. But then they mave very tiny teats, so one wonders whether they were really bred for milk. (And if you hadn't noticed it elsewhere, you will see that I label my cows with a sticky number on the left hond hoof)</p></bloqkquote>

              <p>
                  These four are 'chased' to resemble hair. They are from identical molds, but have
                  different paint jobs. As you can see they also come in two sizes - 'pint' and
                  'half-pint'. They are quite brittle and not well protected in their original boxes
                  and I've had real trouble getting them in one piece; I needed dual shipments from
                  the sellers for all four, and still had to do a bit of restoration.  They are
                  marked for Enesco, LTD which doesn't say a lot about where they were made since
                  Enesco has branches in many countries and its International Headquarters is
                  located in Itasca, Ill. These cows also however have a transparent sticker that
                  says "The James Herriott Country Kitchen Collection, , A7597, Cow Jug", with a
                  smaller round picture of 3 kilns that says Border Fine Arts Pottery Company.  A
                  quick trip to the fabtintoys.com website (a marvelous site to learn about many
                  manufacturers of ceramics as well as toys) says that they are a Division of Enesco
                  LLC located in Kingstown, Carlisle, Cumbria, England.  It also gives a bit of
                  their history: "Border Fine Arts was founded in 1974 by John Hammond, whose chance
                  visit to Scotland served as inspiration for the creative company which thrives
                  today. From humble beginnings in an eighteenth-century farmhouse near Langholm,
                  the fledgling company developed quickly. Carefully researched, highly detailed and
                  accurately painted figurines were created, for which demand grew rapidly from a
                  very receptive marketplace.The workforce grew in leaps and bounds to keep pace
                  with the orders that poured in. Middleholm was quickly outgrown and premises were
                  found in the town, which in turn were expanded to accommodate demand. Border Fine
                  Arts has now become a household name and leader in the manufacture of superb,
                  lifelike figurines. So much so, that In 1986, Border Fine Arts was honoured to win
                  the Scottish Business Achievement Award in recognition of the company's growth and
                  commitment to making a quality product."  It doesn't say when it was acquired by
                  enesco, but John Hammond is now Chairman of Eneskko UK, LTD, so it's worth saying
                  a bit more about Enesco here, from their web site: "Enesco was founded in 1958 as
                  the import division of N. Shure Company, one of the largest and oldest general
                  merchandise catalog companies. Following N. Shure's sale to Butler Brothers, the
                  import division reorganized as Enesco Corporation, formed from the phonic
                  spellings of the prior parent company's name initials - N.S.Co. Enesco was sold
                  four times, culminating in 2007 when Enesco then became a privately-held company
                  and changed its legal name to Enesco, LLC. Balmoral Funds, a Los Angeles, CA based
                  private equity fund acquired Enesco, LLC in 2015."  More than you want or even
                  deserve to know, but once I got started I found it hard to stop.

                  Holes in their head…they must be…?? Only one is marked, and it’s too faded to read. Both came from
                  the UK via eBay, and one of the sellers said he thought his cow was from Beddgelert Pottery
                  (established 1962 and operated by Mrs A, Davey and Mrs P Hancock) which is in Beddgelert, Snowdonia,
                  Wales.  Following the web to Beddgelert’s tourism site, we find an interesting (to me) story, about
                  the village’s most famous historical, feature, “Gelbert’s Grave”.  To quote the site, the headstone
                  reads "In the 13th century Llywelyn, prince of North Wales, had a palace at Beddgelert. One day
                  he went hunting without Gelert, 'The Faithful Hound' who was unaccountably absent. On
                  Llywelyn's return the truant, stained and smeared with blood, joyfully sprang to meet his master. The
                  prince alarmed hastened to find his son, and saw the infant's cot empty, the bedclothes and floor
                  covered with blood. The frantic father plunged his sword into the hounds side, thinking it had killed
                  his heir. The dog's dying yell was answered by a child's cry. Llywelyn searched and discovered his
                  boy unharmed, but near by lay the body of a mighty wolf which Gelert had slain. The prince filled
                  with remorse is said never to have smiled again. He buried Gelert here.”  Following these leads is
                  one of the things I enjoy about my collection (even if they’re wrong – I have seen others like these
                  advertised on eBay with a stamp for a different factory in Wales).</p> </td>

                <p>
                  A Blue version of these large creamers with the big smiles were featured as distinctly British in the Places section.  Three of these examples meet that criterion. On the left the lady with blue flowers is marked for "Royal Crownsford (Honslow) Arthur Wood, England, Safe Harbour', which is a bit confusing because the Safe Harbour cows generally have a distinctive decoration like the one just below, and also the Royal Crownsford label generally doesn't come from one of the Wood studios.  The one with red flowers simply says Made in England, and the dark green one on the far right while unmarked is most likey from Arthur Wood since I have seen some like it so stamped.  The 'sport' here is the white one with blue decorations in the right hand photo. It's marked as a "Blue Onion" pattern, with a sticker that states it's "Made Expressly for M.B.Daniels & Co., Ics,  Made in Japan".  Apparently Mr Daniels wanted to take advantage of the popularity of this mold, but found a relatively cheap way to do so.

                  popular and widespread in the UK. It is marked "Old Flow Blue", from
                  Crownford China, England.  In addition to the variety of colors and styles
                  in which this creamer has been produced by quite a large number of British
                  factories, what I find interesting is that the Japanese apparently took
                  advantage of its popularity to fashion a creamer quite similar to it, here
                  in brown and stamped 'Japan'.  Its features are really much the same - big
                  nose, smile, and all - but it has a much larger back opening, a heavier

                <p> Heading up a number of sections with cow creamers from<strong> Japan </strong>, here in white and with flowers is another example of the Japanese version of the cows in the section immediately above..
                    The seller, who hails from near Minneapolis, noted, "My husband remembers
                    his mom bringing this out to serve the cream in when they had company. That
                    was in the early 1950's, so this creamer is at least 50 years old. It's been
                    in storage since they moved off the farm in the late 50's".  For some reason
                    there was a lot of competition for this one on eBay, while I was the only
                    bidder on the brown one.  The Japanese seem also to have made a smaller
                    version, with similar facial features though a bit of a different body
                    shape.  Clever and entrepreneurial folks, those post-WWII Japanese
                    ceramicists.<br>

                  The latest to join the herd is on the left.  It’s marked with an open wreath around a three leaf

                  Yoko-Boeki Co.  (I’m told the factory is still in operation).  The seller says that it came from

                  was a whole set of items that accompanied the cow.</p>

                  This is an interesting pair of Japanese luster creamers.  I believe they’re from the same mold,
                  albeit the horns of the yellowish one have been set at a different angle.  The marks are different –
                  the purple one has two concentric circles with a 5-petaled flower in the middle and “Made in Japan”
                  between.  I haven’t been able to identify it, but pretty obviously the piece was made for export. 
                  Thanks to Jan-Erik Nilsson’s wonderful <a href="http://www.gotheborg.com/">www.gotheborg.com</a> site
                  (which I’ve referred to elsewhere for help with my Chinese teapots), I have been able to identify the
                  red elephant head mark on the yellow cow as indicating Tashiro Shoten of Yokohama.  “Shoten”
                  indicates a shop that sells products from its own kiln; this one was active from the 1930’s, from
                  when this mark dates, till it closed in 1954. There are sugar and creamers from both or these potteries on that page.</p>

                  Portuguese </strong> cow creamers.  These two fancy ones are hand painted in faience style. Written on the

                  Berardos is one of 9 independent ceramics factories in Condeixa, Coimbra. The writing on the smaller
                  one reads “117, Ceramica Conimbriga, Sec XVII, Hand Painted Portugal, Lena”.  From the website
                  Portugal Ceramica, we learn that “Recovering a vanishing tradition, Cerâmica de Conímbriga settled in
                  Condeixa-a-Nova in 1960, converting this small town in the centre of Coimbra's traditional Portuguese
                  ceramic. Through the hand of the artist who conceived it, Vaz Lameiro, the art of hispano-arabic
                  ceramic and traditional Portuguese faience (15th through 19th centuries) was developed, creating a
                  prestigious name and establishing itself as a school.”  From Portugal2U, we further find that “The
                  Pieces are reproductions of the Decorations of the 15th and 17th Centuries faiences …This ceramic
                  it’s the only in Portugal, that represents the east tradition, and mainly the influence of Chinese
                  and Arab style. .. Carlos Tomas the artist behind this factory, iniciated its activity as a painter
                  at 11 y.old in the famous and extinct "Ceramica de Conimbriga";, and maintains not only the
                  quality this factory was famous for, as well as the Moulds that are unique to that Fabric, being able

                  Not all Portuguese cows are so fancy or tell such interesting stories.  Here, the plain white heavy
                  ceramic cow with the yellow horns is stamped “By Martan for Hess’s, Portugal”, and its partner, from
                  the same mold but with flowers, is simply stamped ‘Portugal’.  The <a href="http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/0/010656dat3.html">www.portugalvirtual.pt/0/010656dat3.html</a>

                  sure it that’s the same place, or if somehow this cow is a plumber.  Hess’s was a Department store
                  chain based in Allentown, PA that was established in 1897, but it was liquidated in 1994, so again

                  where from Walter Del Pellegrino writing in http://italianpotterymarks.freeforums.org/post160.html I
                  found that “The factory 'Este Pottery and Porcelain' was founded in 1893 by the merger
                  Brunello di Giovanni Battista with the factory of Varion Franchini, both active since the mid 18th
                  century, with the same type of production based on pottery tableware, figurines and monumental
                  centerpieces . Este porcelain established itself as an internationally important porcelain firm in
                  1956 when Giovanni Giorgini Battista re-opened the factory after the end of World War II. The factory
                  is located in the same building occupied by the original 'Este Ceramiche Porcellane' created in 1753,
                  thus making Este one of the oldest ceramics factories still in use in the world. Today, the factory
                  is owned by Giorgini's grandson, Giovanni Battista Fadigati.  Este's products are found in exclusive,
                  high-end stores around the world but the majority of its export ends up the U.S. The Este mark shown
                  [here, on my cow] dates the piece from the late 1950's through the 1960's”.  For yet more
                  information, I can recommend V.O.W. No36 on www.yatzer.com, where there is a nice write-up and also a
                  really neat movie about the factory and its products.</p>

                  on their base indicates they were made in Italy for Meiselman Imports of New York.  From the little I
                  can find on the web, Meiselman specialized in rather fine ceramics and china, mostly made on the
                  continent.   One web site indicates it was also known as Ben Har Imports of NY (registered on 4 Jan
                  1965 and listed as inactive – dissolution – 21 Sep 1981) and was active in the 1960s. Meiselman and

                  handwriting what is either the mold or maker’s identification, and the unusually colored blue one
                  with the green base has written in black a mold mark, “Italy”, and “Raymor”.  A web search indicates
                  that Raymor was an American distributor of domestic products, in business from around 1941 to the
                  1980s.  After WWII they apparently imported a range of Italian and Scandinavian ceramics from a large
                  number of artists and manufacturers.  From what I’ve found on the web it seems that most of their
                  items had a Raymor paper label, so whether this cow was actually brought to the US by them is
                  somewhat problematic.  Whatever the case, it was fun to find such different versions. </p>

                <p>These two creamers are fashioned from rather common molds, but with quite brilliant
                  and lovely ‘cloisonné’ enamel coatings. The seller says he got them in a market
                  near Bordeaux, as “La Louviere, in the style of Longwy. La Louvierre is
                  located
                  in the Belgian Wallonia province of Hainaut. It is the home of Boch Freres
                  Keramis, founded in 1841. Longwy lies on the French side of the three-point border
                  with Belgium and Luxemborg, and its pottery Workshop was established by the Huart
                  family in a previous Carmelite monastery in 1798. From the Emaux de Longwy web
                  site we learn that “after the siege of 1815, J. A. Nothomb, together with his
                  partner Christine Boch, perfectionized the clay-past. Their grandchildren,
                  Hyppolite and Henri-Ferdinand d'Huart reacted brilliant on the overwhelming  attention for the ceramics
				  from the Middle East. The added the Cloisonné technique
                  to their objects d'art and that was a shot in the rose (sic).” They substituted
                  black clay for the metal cords normally used in the orient to contain the different
                  colored enamels, and that is the technique used on these creamers. Apparently
                  artists changed jobs between the potteries in La Louviere and Longwy, which
                  explains the transfer of techniques and thus the attribution of these creamers to
                  the former.</p>

                <p>These three German porcelain beauties seem to come from similar if not identical molds…but the
                  smallest one is unmarked, and the middle dark brown one simply bears the word “Germany”. The lightest
                  of the three, also shown by itself, has a mark that includes a shield with a German double-eagle over
                  “Schwarzburg”.  That mark was used between 1904 and 1924 by Porzellanfabrik Rudolstadt Straus &
                  Sohne A.G., which operated from 1882-1930.  This company started as Lazarus Strauss & Sons in
                  1869 in Rudolstadt, Germany but was sufficiently successful to become US based in 1882 as the New
                  York and Rudolstadt Pottery, and it eventually established additional factories in France and
                  Austria.  I would imagine that all three of these creamers came from the Rudolstadt factory, and
                  probably date from the early 1900s.</p> </blockquote>

                  description of the process) of “The Lightship Memorial” at Margate.  One reason I like these early
                  souvenir cows is that I get to learn about new places and events. In this case, Wikipedia informed me
                  that “Margate is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort" title="Seaside resort">seaside

                "Margate" in 1299, but the spelling continued to vary into modern times. The name is
                  thought to refer to a pool gate or gap in a cliff where pools of water are found, often allowing
                  swimmers to jump in. The cliffs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Thanet" title="Isle of Thanet">Isle
                    of Thanet</a> are composed of chalk, a fossil-bearing rock.The town's history is tied closely to
                  the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. Margate was a 'limb' of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover"

                  Margate has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250&nbsp;years. Like its neighbour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate"
                    title="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>, it has been a traditional holiday destination for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"

                  a ship that had gone aground on the Margate Sands after a collision.  Margate lifeboat crews  much
                  later won praise for their heroic efforts ferrying British and French  troops from the beaches of
                  Dunkirk during the 1940 evacuation.</p>

                <p>Here are three lovely East German porcelain creamers. I had trouble identifying the maker’s marks
                  until I got the lying down cow that says “Made in GDR”; the other standing cows somewhat misleadingly
                  read “Dresden China, Germany”. Thanks to PM&M (<a href="http://www.porcelainmarksandmore.com/">www.porcelainmarksandmore.com</a>)
                  I learned a bit of their history. The mark indicates that they were made by Porzellanfabrik Friedrich
                  Eger & Co. which is in the village of Martinroda (part of the town of Vacha since the end of
                  2013) in Thuringia, Germany.  This company was founded in 1901, reached its peak ~1930, had to stop
                  production shortly after the start of WWII, and then restarted in 1946.  Thuringia became party of
                  Communist East Germany – the German Democratic Republic, GDR – in 1949, but the factory remained
                  privately owned until 1972. At that time it was nationalized and renamed V.E.B. Porzellanwerk
                  Martinroda as part of the V.E.B. Zierporzellan Lichte combinate. Production was stopped in 1977 when
                  the factory was changed into a V.E.B. decoration division. After German reunification in 1990 it took
                  back its original name and struggled to get back into the market.  Since my standing cows read
                  “Germany” not “GDR” I believe they were made prior to nationalization, i.e. sometime before 1972, and
                  that their lying down cousin was produced after nationalization.   The term “Dresden China” was
                  confusing since Dresden is in Saxony, much further to the east.  A couple sites (including
                  gaulartifact.com) however have pointed out that Dresden China, or Dresden Porcelain, refers less to
                  the city and more to an ‘artistic movement’ and the use of ‘white gold’ or hard paste porcelain, the
                  recipe for which – previously the exclusive knowledge of the Chinese -   was discovered in Dresden
                  during the reign of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, around 1708. Once the recipe was known
                  quite a number of porcelain manufactories grew up in the area, most notably Meissen, and apparently
                  the art and the name of the material carried over into neighboring Thuringia. </p>

                  debated where to place it, but decided to put it  above the Monk cows because it came from the

                  Here are three beautifully made Monk cows. Like the cow above they are unmarked and while sold as
                  Schafer and Vater I don’t believe they are (different glaze, different bisque, not typical S&V
                  features), although they also most likely came from some other maker in the Rudolstadt area of
                  Germany, probably dating to post WWI.  I first acquired the small light brown one after some furious
                  bidding on Ebay.  My second acquisition was the large dark brown one. I have seen one like it in the
                  Rice collection at Taylor University – and although larger at 6 ½” tall, it was considerably less
                  expensive.  Then I managed to acquire the middle-sized one in the blue robe – as a still lower
                  price.  I’m wondering how many more versions there may be, and if the price will keep dropping. </p>

                  I used to think that the one on the right would win some sotrt of ‘ugly contest’ prize. Then its couin showed up, sharing some facial feathues and the "Made in  Germany" stamo on the base. This pair is also on page 1 of Modern variations, but is repeated here so I can note that they are hard bisque porcelain, and much in the style of, if not by Schafer & Vater. I have heard that there were  a number of factories in the Ronstadt area of Germany that made uch 'whiumsies' in the early 20c and indeed I have included a gost and elephant on the S&V page that I suspect came from the place that made these two, likely NOT S&V although they were sold as such. </a>

                  non-informative stamp, “Made in Germany” between two circles.  This very cute early 20c nursemaid in a Cornish dress came to
                  me via eBay from the UK as do many of the nice English and continental ones. I later got unmarked ones reading "A Present from Gt Yarmouth" and "A Present fro Southend-on-Sea"  which can be found on the advertising and souvenirs page. </p>

                  by Stanisław Wiza. The factory was rebuilt on the site of two previous potteries "Tuppak"
                  and "Silesia". Initially it was a very small concern with few employees and few small
                  electric kilns. The pottery flourished due to careful attention to design, both in body shapes and
                  patterns. The manufacturing process was also improved, new kilns and better clays plus more attention
                  to detail. All this achieved results both at home in Poland and abroad. At present Wiza employs about
                  120 people.”  To learn more about Polish pottery from a number of factories, as well as other Polish

The name is derived from the Silesian duke Bolesław I the Tall. The castellany of Bolezlauez in Lower Silesia was first mentioned in a 1201 deed. According to tradition, its citizens took part in the Battle of Legnica during the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1241...(and) For its long-standing pottery-making tradition, Bolesławiec is celebrated as Miasto Ceramiki or "Town of Ceramics".</p></td>

                  marks, I have yet to identify the factory that used this one. Since they say “Made in” (a common
                  practice in many countries it seems) they were pretty obviously made for the export trade.  With the
                  exception of the large bull pitcher and the one with polka dots (stamped simply “Made in
                  Czechoslovakia” with no circle), they seem to be fairly common and are frequently on offer on eBay.  
                  Interestingly, I haven’t yet found any purely ‘Czech’ or ‘Slovak’ cows from after the peaceful
                  dissolution of the two countries on 1 January 1993 (later note: Finally found some).  Since Czechoslovakia didn’t exist as a sovereign
                  nation until October 1918,  and was partially incorporated into Nazi Germany from 1939-1945 and then
                  came under Communist control until 1990, I’d have to guess that these creamers date from sometime in
                  the 20s or 30s…which also makes sense since creamers of this sort were popular during that period.

				  <a href="facebook.com/leander.porcelain/">facebook.com/leander.porcelain</a>. From an earlier version of their
				  web page I learned that “A
                  porcelain manufactory was established in 1907 in Loučky. The factory produces top-quality white and
                  pink porcelain. LEANDER products are exclusive from the point of view of shapes and decorations.
                  Artists of the factory who possess high professional skills and creative approach create truly unique
                  and original porcelain items. Prestige of the company and exceptional quality of its products are
                  evidenced by fulfillment of exclusive orders for the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the Senate of
                  the Czech Republic and for the President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel.”  It goes on to give a
                  history of the factory, and notes that since 2006 when it was sold to CS Investment Czech holding it
                  produces porcelain under 3 trademarks – Leander, like this one, is mass-market; Leadnder HoReCa for
                  hotels and the service industry; and Rudolf Kampf for ‘exclusive premium-class handmade porcelain.’ 
                  From my perspective it’s nice to know that the Czech Republic hasn’t entirely given up on cows!</p>

                  Now, this fascinates me.  The brown creamer with the raised cow and milkmaid is, yet again,
                  Czechoslovakian, with the red circular stamp.  The white one is unmarked.  It is made of very heavy
                  ceramic, and would appear to be a hand made version of the brown one.  Did someone break a beloved
                  original and make a replacement? Was some artisan practicing for an audition at the Czech factory?

                  both it and the one from Czechoslovakia are modeled after this grey one from Germany (which is why it's here rather tyhan with the rest of the German cow creamers). Its features
                  are much finer, the material is high quality porcelain, there is an open space below the horns, and
                  in addition to a mold number it is marked, in script, “ges gesch” which (as related elsewhere) is the
                  abbreviation for gesetzlich geschützt, meaning a registered design or patent. Pretty obviously some
                  folks didn’t pay much attention to that. </p>

                  Talavera pottery is the ceramic ware produced by certified workshops in the state of
                  Puebla Mexico following the traditional process introduced by the Spaniards (of Talavera de la
                  Reina) in the 16th Century. In 1997 the State of Puebla obtained the Denomination of Origin stating
                  that only the pottery produced in the geographical region of the State of Puebla or Zona de Talavera
                  (Talavera Zone) and that follows the standards set by the Consejo Regulador de la Talavera
                  (Regulating Council of Talavera) can be called Talavera. In order to be
                  certified these workshops have to pass an inspection and verification process every six months. So,
                  just as Champagne is only produced in Champagne, France, Talavera can only be produced in Puebla,
                  Mexico.”  </p>

                <p>  We end this world tour with <strong> China,</strong> although the ones shown in this and the next couple sections could more properly be called South Asia because the desuigner shopped around for makers.
                  This large gold creamer with the Chinese decorations has a sticker which says “Designed and painted
                  in Hong Kong by Maitland Smith”. From eBay’s Popular Items selection, I found that “In 1979, a
                  prominent London antiques dealer and designer [Paul Maitland-Smith] founded the company in Hong Kong.
                  It reproduced eighteenth century decorative accessories and furniture. Highly-skilled artisans and
                  quality raw materials were easily available to produce fine vintage furniture and accessories. The
                  company shifted to Philippines in 1981 and started the first wholly-owned manufacturing facility.
                  This facilitated greater emphasis over quality and a wider product offering. Later, a new facility
                  was built in Indonesia in the early 1990s to further expand its in-house designing and manufacturing
                  processes.” Digging further, from a 1996 Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing, we find that
                  Maitland-Smith Inc. has a number of Asia holdings, but was itself (along with many others) a
                  subsidiary of  Lifestyle Furnishings International, Ltd.  They in turn started divesting themselves
                  of furniture companies in 2002, and now Maitland-Smith is one of the brands of Furniture Brands
                  International, Inc., which according to their web site is “the largest furniture manufacturer in the
                  United States (and) was once the largest footwear manufacturer in the United States called the
                  International Shoe Company.” It also has an intriguing history, starting in 1898, which can be found
                  on its web site. Amazing what you can learn from a cow! I am also leaning a lesson in pricing from this 
				  gold one - I now have 3. The first came without a lid and cost about $140.  The one shown here has its lid 
				  and cost $18. Then recently I spotted one on eBay - lousy picture and the seller had no idea whet it 
				  was - thet I got for 99 cents. Oh well...

                <p>Anytime an item sells like hotcakes, there is bound to be a knock-off. Here are two. The base of the one on the left is very similar to the Whirley ones, although the legs are depicted
                  differently on the sides, the handle is different, the front plaque is blank, and there is no mark on
                  the bottom.  The head is very different, and actually sort of cute.  It’s the only one of its kind I
                  have ever seen, and I bought it because I initially thought that it might have been a version that
                  was designed by Whirley Chief Engineer John Downey before he came up with the one that they actually
                  manufactured.  It would make sense that they tried out a few variants before settling on one to mass
                  produce.  So I wrote and asked the company’s founder and apparently my guess was wrong because he
                  assured me it was just a knock-off, and ""we sold 10 million and they didn’t sell
                  any!”  Nevertheless, it’s sort of fun to discover the imitations.  I still like my story better even if it is wrong!</p>
				  <p>On the right is another very similar knock-off, actually in two variants. These copies have  a somewhat narrower bottom,
				  the head is quite different and one sports a bow
                  tie, and they are  simply molded in two pieces rather than the several that make up the Whirley version.
                  In addition the head has interlocking tabs to connect to the body, instead of the simple fit of the
                  original. Both are marked n tiny 
				  letter on the back of the head "Made in Hong Kong".  The box and the one with the white front 
				  also carry "8133, Copywrite J.S. NY, 1974".  How one can get a copywrite on a fake  Whirley patant 
				  pending cow creamer is beyond me - but then it might just be the marking, not the reality. Apparently 
				  this knockoff version sold at  least two...

                  in 1977 in cooperation with General Mills, as a promotional toy
                  (cereal…milk…get it?)  You put water in the trough, pushed her head down into it, and pumped the
                  tail. Milky would drink the water, then her head would come up and she’d ‘moo’.  Next you put the
                  bucket under the appropriate part of Milky’s anatomy, pulled on the plastic teat, and cloudy (from a
                  powdered milk substance that came as tablets) water would come out. Neat! Surely some of you must
                  remember this… As shown here, Milky came with a placemat, detailed instructions, and a story booklet
                  entitled "The Adventures of Marko & Melissa Milkdrop with
                  Milky the Marvelous Milking Cow".   From several web pages (e.g., <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.flickr.com/"><span id="lw_1229399132_11">www.flickr.com</span></a> or a wikipedia
                  article), we find that Kenner was started by Albert, Philip and Joseph Steiner in 1947 and named
                  after the street in Cincinatti, OH where its offices were located..  It was acquired by General Mills
                  in 1967.  They merged it with Rainbow Crafts in 1970, then in 1985 spun off their Kenner and Parker
                  divisions to form Kenner Parker toys, which was bought by Tonka in
                  1987; Hasbro then bought Tonka in 1991, and shut Kenner down in 2000, merging its products into their
                  brand line.   Milky is of course no longer made, but is still very popular; she sells well on Ebay to folks that played with her as a child and want to get a
                  version for their own kids. </p>

                <p>Here's a much simpler approach - in a plush-toy cow with plastic horns and a pink
                  bow with flowers.  You simply take out the plastic plug on her back, fill the tube
                  with milk from a dropper, and as the instructions read, "Milking is done
                  realistically - by squeezing the udder" (well, I guess that's somewhat close to
                  realistic though I wouldn't suggest trying it on the real thing). As her tag says, this is
                  "MILKA MOO, the Milking Cow" made by Ideal ("Made in U.S.A. by Ideal
                  Novelty and Toy Company, Hollis 7, N.Y.").  From Wikipedia we find that "Ideal Toy
                  Company was founded as Ideal Novelty and Toy Company in New York in 1907 by Morris
                  and Rose Michtom after they had invented the Teddy bear in 1903. The company
                  changed its name to Ideal Toy Company in 1938. In 1982, the company was sold to CBS
                  Toy Company, which itself closed down. Certain brands and toys have been continued
                  through other companies, most notably the Magic 8-ball and Rubik's Cube."  That's
                  nice to know because it helps date MILKA to pre-1938.g  Getting to be an old cow, even
                  older than me (though not by much)! interestingly, she isn't listed on the Wikipedia page among the toys
                  and novelties made by Ideal. I guess I'll have to make my first Wikipedia
                  contribution some day soon!</p></blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                <p>In addition to huge Milky, there are some tiny plastic milking toys.  I have three versions of
                  these.  First is “Jersey Jessie the Milking Moo-Cow”.  Jessie was made by Thomas Toy. The placard
                  around her neck says, “Lift my tail and I’ll fill the pail”.  Jessie is a lot simpler mechanically
                  than Milky – you simply rotate her udder, remove it, fill the little rubber bulb above it with water
                  or milk, and put it back in; lifting the tail compresses the bulb and presto!  In the second picture,
                  the little black cow standing tail to tail with Jessie is very similar, albeit the neck is longer and
                  the buckle on her collar is on the opposite side.  Her side imprint reads “Tudor
                    Rose”, and on the other side, “Made in England”.  This company also made ramp walking cows
                  that had the same body and head shape.  Other than that, I haven’t been able to find out anything
                  about these little guys – not even who copied whom. In the third picture, the little brown and white
                  cow with the curved horns and black bell operates the same way, but is obviously from a different
                  mold.  I have no information about that one.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Here are a couple more Jersey Jessies, one with its original cardboard placard.
                  Jersey Jessie was one of innumerable plastic toys made by Thomas Manufacturing
                  Corporation of Newark, NJ. The company was started by Islyn Thomas in 1944, after he
                  had worked for Consolidated Molded Products Corporation and the Ideal Plastics
                  Corporation starting in 1940. . The company lasted until 1963. If you want to learn
                  more about this company or about other plastic toys of that era, go

                   , but basically they were founded in New York City by Louis and his brother David in 1919.  Louis
                  sold the company to Quaker Oats and retired (a rich man) in 1972 and they in turn sold it to
                  Dunbee-Combex-Marx of the UK.  The Marx brand disappeared in 1978, and the company went bankrupt in
                  1980; the rights to some of the toys were sold and some are apparently still in production.  Not this
                  cow though, at least not recently.</p>

                  Same idea, different approach:  This old and much-loved cow is rubber; you squeeze her sides, stick
                  the nose in water, release and she fills up.  Then there’s a little detent on a spring in the middle
                  of her udder that you depress to have the liquid come out the other end.  I have no information about
                  this one – it isn’t marked, but it’s certainly been well used since the fuzz is completely rubbed off
                  the side where you’d squeeze her. Age? Well, I’ve seen another advertised on eBay as having been
                  found wrapped in a 1932 newspaper…</p>

                  significant differences – the larger one is ‘fully (if minimally for a bull) equipped’, the smaller
                  lacks such distinguishing features, and the smaller one has saddle markings and a loop on the top of
                  its head.  The sellers gave very different information – the smaller one was said to be sand cast
                  Mexican silver, and it polished up nicely after a bit of elbow grease.  The larger one was sold as
                  likely Persian from late 19c, based primarily on the near eastern collection from which it came.  It
                  didn’t shine up very much, but at least is cleaner for my efforts. Yet another mystery…perhaps
                  eventually I can get some museum curator or collector to advise me. Several years after getting these, I purchased a sterling silver bull with many of the same characteristics - chest ornamentation, saddle, etc, said to be Peruvian.  It's with the other bulls on the silver page. - </p>

                  plus showrooms in Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas and Las Vegas. Mr Kirkland retired in 2002 (presumably as

                <p>This little cow has taken some hits – a bit dented in the side, with the base slightly pushed in,
                  and I haven’t yet forced off the lid.  I believe it’s pewter or some other silver amalgam, with brass
                  head and fittings.  It does have a hole in the mouth so was obviously made to pour something. If it
                  was Indian I’d be tempted to call it a nandi, but it’s clearly impressed “Taiwan” on the brass strap
                  around its middle. I expect it was used for some ceremonial or religious purposes, perhaps to hold
                  oil.  This is another case where I would certainly appreciate some help.</p>

                  His wife Geraldine was the artist – and they stayed in business until they sold the company in 1964. I later got a 
				  teapot from the same maker, so this little pitcher is shown alongside it on that page. 
                  The unmarked black and white one is indeed a creamer – there’s a hole in the mouth; not sure I would

                  equally hard to miss where they were sold. When I was living in the UK however, a ‘half

                  ‘Airport Garden Hotel’ in Beijing, our last night in China (after a couple drinks). It looks sort of

                  The one on the right came via eBay from Australia; it has what would appear to be double horns –
                  small pieces that stick up and longer ones that sweep back, and it’s exceedingly hairy.  Some strange

                  “The bottom of it says:  Line 1: Suteki, in Katakana, usually reserved for words of foreign import or
                  simple writing for children, means, "Beautiful, wonderful, dreamy." Line 2,  Pifuko, is in Hiragana,
                  a more complex alphabet usually used for native words.  I get Pifuko is the company, or Pifu, and the

                <p>Here is another with a hole in the butt that was sufficiently unusual and inexpensive that it snuck

                  (from Kovels.com) I learned that “Frankoma Pottery was originally known as The Frank Potteries when
                  John F. Frank opened shop in 1933. The factory opened in Ada, Oklahoma, then moved to Sapulpa,
                  Oklahoma in 1938… John Frank died in 1973 and his daughter, Joniece, inherited the business. After
                  financial problems, Frankoma was sold in 1991. The pottery operated under various owners for a few
                  years and was bought by Joe Ragosta in 2008. It closed in 2010. The buildings, assets, name, and
                  molds were sold at auction in 2011.” On the other hand from morethanmccoy.com, another good source of
                  information, we find that “Zanesville Stoneware Company, (ZSC), Zanesville, Ohio. In business from
                  1887-2002. … this company did not like to mark their pottery because imported pottery had to be
                  marked with the country of origin, therefore, Zanesville felt it was not necessary to mark their
                  pottery since it was American made.” Well, at least I learned something from it.</p>

                  hole in the face.  The back hole is quite large however, so I suppose that they could be used as
                  pitchers.  The seller of the black one contended that they were rare and were from SylvaC, which I
                  have learned from Wikipedia was founded in 1894 by William Copestake and William Shaw, and “is a
                  brand of British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_(architecture)" title="Ornament (architecture)">ornamental</a>

                  was resumed in 1998 by the current trademark holder Norman Williams.”  The article states that they
                  are neither rare nor high art but are ‘collectible’.  There is an extensive catalog of their pieces
                  for those who may be interested.  These cows bear the number ‘66’ in an interesting spot – the back
                  of their udder, between the hind legs.  Whether they are actually SylvaC or not I really don’t know,
                  but in spite of their deficiencies from my collection’s standpoint they are quite interesting. </p>

                  I’m closing out this theme section with a number of creamers from Cow Parade. Cow Parade bills itself
                  as ‘the world’s largest public art event’.  The concept originated in Zurich in 1998, and the first
                  show was in Chicago in 1999.  There have since been shows in some 40 cities around the world, and it
                  has spurred a number of public art events featuring other animals, e.g  bears,  horses, and fish, as
                  well as a whole line of figurines featuring some of the wilder designs.  At one point the company
                  that produces the figurines made a number of creamers and sugar-and-creamer sets from some of the
                  ‘simpler’ designs.  These are all from the same molds, but bear the decorations associated with their
                  names.  There are also teapot versions of these two, Fruits of Summer and Where’s the Beef.  I’d
                  imagine that somewhere there’s a record of the name of the artist that did each cow, plus information
                  on where the full size one was located, but I haven’t found it.</p>
