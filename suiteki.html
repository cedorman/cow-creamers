          <h1>Suiteki</h1>

          <p>As I stated on the home page, this is a later addition to the collection, of
            interest to me because they meet the ‘two hole’ rule, and because I wanted some
            traditional versions of a cow, bull, ox or water buffalo from the lactose intolerant
            populations of the Far East... and also, as noted below, because my wife got me
            hooked on them.</p>

          <p>Probably the best overall explanation of suiteki that I have found comes from a
            very informative article at the <a href="http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/">Japanese
              Art and Architecture Net Users System (JAANUS)</a> web site, from which -- and I
            quote – we learn that the Japanese term Suiteki means:</p>

          <table width="95%">
            <tr>
              <td>Lit. water-dropper. A small container used to hold the
                water which is added to the inkstone ‘suzuri’ during the grinding of the ink
                stick. Water-droppers may be made of copper, jade and stone, but ceramic are the
                most popular. Depending on their size and shape, water-droppers may also be termed
                suichuu, suichuujou  (also suijou), suiu  or senjo. More specifically, a suiteki has
                two small holes for water and air and is designed so that only a few drops of water
                can fall at one time. Suichuu are shaped like pitchers and have a pouring spout and
                a handle. Suiu and suijou are bowl or jar-like, and some have wide mouths, making
                them popular for use as brush washers (hissen), while others have small
                mouths. Senjo, or &quot;toad&quot;, was so named because a toad was believed to hold
                water in its large belly. Thus many jade toad-shaped water-droppers exist. At first
                the suiteki was simply a jar or bowl used for holding water, but as interest in the
                accoutrements of calligraphy grew, water-droppers became more specialized. Bronze
                water-droppers in the shapes of fantastic creatures [monsters], ceramic suiu and
                teapot-shaped suichuu were created in China and found their way to Japan and became
                popular with the literati of the Edo period. In Japan, suiteki were already used in
                the Nara period (7c) when sutra copying flourished. A set from this period made up
                of a bronze water-dropper, a spoon and a tray used to hold the ink stick are
                preserved at Houryuuji, Nara. Since the late Heian period (11c), a special kind of
                writing box ‘suzuribako’, which includes the water-dropper, in addition to the ink
                stone and other writing tools, became very popular. The water-droppers varied
                greatly in material, shape and design. Notable, are the elaborately designed ceramic
                suiteki, including many animal-shaped examples, that were found among old Seto (13c)
                and Oribe (16c) wares (see ‘setoyaki’, ‘oribeyaki’) Water-droppers of richly colored
                cloisonne (shippou) also became popular from the 16c.</td>

                  simple reclining beasts. The larger and fatter one came to me from Kumamoto,
                  on the western shore of Kyushu. The other arrived from Okayama in southern
                  Honshu. Many of my other Japanese suiteki feature what would seem to be
                  working bulls or water buffalo, but these are pretty clearly cows for milking
                  or more likely for eating. The fatter one looks like it would be great for the
                  world renowned Kobe Beef. Both are beautifully molded and cast, and the
                  smaller one even has the leg beneath depicted.</p>

                  claws and is more interested in meat than companionship. There may well be a story or
                  ‘fairy tale’ that goes with it, but the Japanese seller provided no information.</p>

There is a large bizen suiteki further down the page that also has a Buddha on its forehead so I'm pretty sure that's what it was meant to be.  The seller, from Hyogo Japan, said it was post-1940 although it looks to me to have a bit of age. But then I was born in 1940 and I too have a bit of age...</p></td>

                <p>This small but very well done early 20c copper or bronze suiteki of a boy
                  with a flute riding a water buffalo came to me from Okayama, Japan, which is about
                  half-way between Kobe and Hiroshima.  The seller told me that the boy or man
                  riding a water buffalo is a traditional theme of Zen Buddhism – which of course
                  sent me to digging through the web.  I learned that this is a representation of
                  the sixth stage from an early Taoist story of the ‘Ten Bulls’  that (according to
                  Wikipedia) may represent a Zen Buddhist interpretation of
                  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhumi_(Buddhism)" title="Bhumi
                  (Buddhism)">ten
                    stages</a> experienced by
                  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> as outlined
                  in
                  various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana_sutras" title="Mahayana
                  sutras">Mahāyāna
                    sūtras</a>. The wikipedia article states that the story as
                  related by the 12c  Chinese Zen master Kuòān Shīyuǎn has pictures, poems and short
                  pieces of prose that “tell how the student ventures into the wilderness in his
                  search for &quot;the Bull&quot; (or &quot;Ox&quot;; a common metaphor for
                  enlightenment, or the true self, or simply a regular human being), and how his
                  efforts prove fruitless at first. Undeterred, he keeps searching and eventually
                  finds footprints on a riverbank. When he sees the bull for the first time he is
                  amazed by the splendour of its features ('empty and marvelous' is a well known
                  phrase used to describe the perception of Buddha nature). However, the student has
                  not tamed the bull, and must work hard to bring it under control. Eventually he
                  reaches the highest Enlightenment, returns to the world and ‘everyone I look upoon
                  becomes enlightened’.” The sixth stage has the man riding the bull home in great
                  joy, and in the 12c picture he is playing a flute.  Whether or not this is the
                  correct interpretation of this suiteki, many in my collection  – Chinese as well
                  as Japanese – feature a person riding, climbing or lying on a standing or
                  reclining bull (water buffalo).  </p>

                  detail, down to the  rope through the nose.  One of these came to me from
                  California a couple years ago – then I couldn’t resist its twin, which arrived
                   direct from a seller in Tottori-shi, Tottori-ken, Japan.  That of course sent me
                  to the web, where I learned that Tottori Prefecture, located in the Chugoku region
                  of southwest Honshu, is the least populous prefecture in Japan, and has the
                  nation’s only large area of sand dunes. From Wikipedia, always the source of fun
                  information, I found that ‘The word &quot;Tottori&quot; in Japanese is formed from
                  two <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" title="Kanji">kanji</a></em>

                  ware, and was said by the knowledgeable seller to be about a hundred years old.  
                  Of course I scampered to the web to find out a bit about  Seto, which is in Aichi
                  Prefecture, some 20 km NE of Nagoya.  I learned that Seto is one of Japan’s most
                  important ancient kiln towns (along with Bizen, Echizen, Tokoname, Shigaraki and
                  Tanba), and indeed is so closely associated with ceramics that ‘setomono’ (瀬戸
                  物)which translates simply as seto ware, is the Japanese generic name for
                  pottery.  Ceramic production in Seto dates back to the Heian period (794-1185),
                  but according to one of the web sources became prominent in the 13C when the
                  craftsman Toshiro Kato set up his kiln there on his return from China where he
                  learned porcelain production. He selected Seto because of its two types of high
                  quality clay (kibushi and gaerome), and naturally enough a number of other
                  artisans followed his lead.   These days Seto is noted for its several ceramics
                  museums and festivals, as well as ceramic production which now includes industrial
                  appliances as well as artistic pieces.</p></blockquote>

I got it at a rock-bottom price (in spite of my bid on esnipe) because for some reason not one else bid on it and the knowledgavble Japanese seller rom Tottori-shi starded the bidding low.</p>

They are each a little different althogh this seems to be a very popular theme, perhaps because a lot of boys do really climb onto the backs of their water buffalo. This one is Japanese, and it is really quite different from its Chinese counterparts. First it's porcelain and very finely molded. Of even more interest, at least to me, is that the fill hole is carefully covered with the boy's removable hat. Very clever and a very nice touch. It came in a nice wooden box.</p></td>

        <p> Here is a second bizen ware or, as the Japanese seller called it, bizen-yaki suiteki, this time in the form
          of a seemingly well fed and contented reclining cow. The seller states that it dates from the Japanese Meiji
          period, 1868-1912, and notes that bizen does not have glaze applied, rather that a sort of natural glaze
          develops in the kiln. He also says, "sometimes we represent it with a Wabi-Sabi". I dashed to Wikipedia for
          help with that, and discovered that "In traditional Japanese aesthetics, wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a world view
          centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of
          beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete". It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching
          of the three marks of existence (三法印 sanbōin), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō), suffering (苦 ku) and
          emptiness or absence of self-nature (空 kū).Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include asymmetry,
          roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of
          natural objects and processes....According to Leonard Koren, wabi-sabi can be defined as 'the most
          conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional Japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same
          position in the Japanese pantheon of aesthetic values as do the Greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the
          far West.' Whereas Andrew Juniper notes that 'If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense
          of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi.' For Richard
          Powell, 'Wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts,
          nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.'" This lovely piece does have a tiny chip on the tip of the left
          horn, but given the above definitions, that seems totally appropriate.</p>

          <p>Moving now to <strong>Chinese calligraphy instruments</strong>, let's start with one that's not a water dropper but rather a lovely  'water pot' - with a large hole on the top and no 2nd or pouring hole - used for washing brushes. This is another exception to my rule, but it's very well made and accompanies the water droppers and other 'scholar's' implements for writing and painting. Japanese versions of such water pots  are often referred to (on ebay at least) as suiteki suichi, but I have no idea what term the Chinese use. This water buffalo or bull is
            particularly beautiful as well as quite large (7” long). It is glazed in what the seller termed ‘sang de
            boeuf’. From Carters.com we learn that “Flambé
            glazes, termed ‘sang-de-boeuf’ (ox blood) were in use by the Chinese from the 11th
            century, and the effect was achieved by using copper oxide as a colouring agent
            and firing the object in a reducing atmosphere. In the 18th century the red glaze
            often accumulated on the shoulders of vases and bowls, reproducing the effect of
            coagulated blood. Sometimes the glaze was often slightly streaked, or included
            blue bleeds and wares with these features were prized by collectors in the 19th
            century. European potters were not able to master the technique until the early
            20th century.” The glaze on this pot seems to me to be somewhat too light for
            that, and is mottled with a grey-green background and dark green occasional
            spots. Perhaps some expert can enlighten me.  Like other of my vintage Chinese
            pieces the bottom is rough and unglazed. It came to me from northern Wales, but the seller said she bought
            it at an antique center in Singapore around the turn of the millennium.</p>

            lasted from 1368-1644, and was followed by the Qing (last Imperial) dynasty which
            lasted until 1912.  Kangxi (4 May 1654-20 December 1722), considered one of China’s greatest emperors and the longest-reigning, was the 4th 
			Qing emperor, and ruled for 61 years, from
            1661-1722.  It would take an expert to verify this attribution or narrow things
            down a bit and I’m certainly not one, but at the very least it makes a good story
            and these very interesting water droppers are fully appropriate to lead off my

            also Chinese.  It seems to me a very clever way of controlling how much water you get and use - and may work for a bit of washing or wetting a brush as well as getting the appropriate amount for the ink. I have seen horse and sheep versions of this form.  </p>

        <p>Boys apparently like to climb onto the back of water buffalo. Here are 4
          versions – the reddish one  with the boy with a light colored head is a
          modern water dropper made of Yixing clay . This clay, from the region near Yixing
          in Jiangsu province, has been used since the Song Dynasty and is very popular for
          teapots because their unglazed surfaces absorb traces of the contents, leading to
          a more complex flavor…thus they should never be washed with detergents, or used
          for more than one type of tea. The bark brown one with the boy with a green shirt
          and purple shorts came to me from the Netherlands and was said by the seller to
          date from ~1900. Its quality and the look of the clay lead me to believe that’s
          not unlikely, and one like this may have served as the model for the others. The
          dark green one is less well molded, glazed on the bottom, and
          likely somewhat younger. It came to me via an antique shop in Missouri. The
          fourth, of brown clay  comes from a slightly different mold; the
          boy’s head is larger and his face more expressive, and the fill hole if on the
          water buffalo’s but rather than the boy’s back.</p></blockquote>

            Kiln” which of course sent me right away to Google.  From chinaculture.org and
            chinauniquetour.com I learned that “The porcelain of Longquan ware represented a
            great school of southern celadon that arose in the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It was
            manufactured in fairly vast areas in the southwestern part of East China's
            Zhejiang Province. The sites of former celadon kilns and workshops are found
            throughout the counties of Lishui, Suichang, Yuehe, Qingtian, and Longquan on the
            upper Oujiang River, with Longquan as the production center. There were also many
            kiln sites in Pucheng along the Songxi River in the northern part of East China's
            Fujian Province”…and more, should you care to go to those sites. Wikipedia also
            has a nice article about the many kilns in the area. Pretty obviously mine – which
            cost ~$9.   - does not date from the Song Dynasty; but my attempts to learn more
            about current Long Quan kilns from the seller came to naught thanks to his paucity
            of English. </p></blockqute>

             <p>This water buffalo or bull is even older: 15c Vietnamese, recovered from the

            really neat web site) provided the following information in the eBay description: 
            “In the mid 15th century a junk loaded with over 250,000 fine examples of
            Vietnamese pottery sank to the bottom of the South China Sea in an area called the
            Dragons Embrace, 40km off the coast of Vietnam. The shipwreck was discovered by
            Vietnamese fishermen who began pulling up huge amounts of pottery in their nets. 
            Subsequently the Vietnamese government hired a salvage company to recover the
            massive amount of sunken treasure which was to be auctioned later in the major
            auction houses, in London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, etc.  As a result, the
            Hoi An  sunken treasure has provided both financial and scholarly rewards. Sales
            proceeds, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, have gone to build museums in
            Vietnam and to pay for further excavation and research. With the discovery of
            previously unknown ceramic forms and design, the historical and artistic
            relationship between Vietnam and China has been redefined and the quality from
            this little known chapter of Vietnamese artistic tradition has been
            recognized. This piece was purchased in an antique shop in Saigon”.  For more
            information about the shipwreck,  go to <a href="http://www.thingsasian.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thingsasian.com/</a> and
            search for Hoi An shipwreck.
