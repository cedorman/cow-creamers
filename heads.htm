        <p>This part of the collection  includes some fully legitimate cow creamers (by the criterion of two holes)  which pour through the mouth.  There are  also a few pitchers.</p>

            <p>            The nicest of the head creamers  are the porcelain ones made by Royal Bayreuth – these come in a variety of  colors; the photo of four creamers was also shown in the Favorite Brands theme,  but it is repeated here as a lead-in both to others by Royal Bayreuth, and to some  ‘look-alike’ copies.  These four – actually  two cows and two water buffalo – bear the Royal Bayreuth, Bavaria stamp. The  other two cows are impressed Deponient (as are some of the ones with the  Royal Bayreuth stamp) but without the crest.</p></td>

           <p>Here are three more nice examples of Royal  Bayreuth cow or bull head creamers. To reiterate a bit of what’s in the  Favorite Brands section, Royal Bayreuth has been produced in the same factory  in Tettau, Bavaria, since 1794. They have used a number of different marks,  usually including the Bavarian coat of arms, two lions rampant and a shield.  The words “Royal Bayreuth” generally indicate that the piece was made for  export to the US.</p></td>

Quail is best known for their animals, birds, and especially (ugh!) cats…they have a range of named cats called “The Moggies” that apparently are quite popular, although why anyone would be the least interested in collecting ceramic cats is completely beyond me.  Cow creamers of course are a different story…but as far as I can tell, these are the only ones of this lovely animal that they have produced.  The Fresian came first, and bears a simple “Q” as the makers mark on its base, while the Jersey’s mark reads “Quail, 2010”.    Perhaps others will follow. </p></td>

The molds are identical,  albeit the white one is ceramic and the black one is made from the red clay  typical of Jackfield creamers, and indeed has the Jackfield glaze with gold highlights.  These were both quite expensive and the  shipping prices from the UK were high, but they are sufficiently lovely as well  as unusual that I couldn’t resist them.   Thankfully the sellers packed well and they made it here unscathed.</p></td>

She had  a large creamer collection and this was her favorite. They are no longer quite  so cheap.  I also believe that they  were made in just these three sizes; and it has taken me many years to acquire  one of each.<u></u><u></u></p>
