	<blockquote>
          <p>This is a really fun part of the collection, essentially just heads of cows
            or bulls (or water buffalo).  If you've looked at the Advertising and
            Souvenirs page, you have already seen some - the Borden's Elmer and Elsie head
            creamers and sugars, and some Japanese copies thereof.  Most of these are
            fully legitimate cow creamers (by the criterion of two holes) which pour
            through the mouth, but there are also a few pitchers.</p></blockquote>

          <p>Here are three more nice examples of Royal Bayreuth cow or bull head creamers. To reiterate a bit of
            what’s in the Favorite Brands section, Royal Bayreuth has been produced in the same factory in Tettau,
            Bavaria, since 1794. They have used a number of different marks, usually including the Bavarian coat of
            arms, two lions rampant and a shield. The crest, name Royal Bayreuth and Bavaria were used from 1870-1919,
            and some later ones may say Germany or even U.S.Zone from 1945-49. Many made for export also bear an
            impressed 'Deponiert' which in English translates to deposited. Next, here are some that were either made
            by Royal Bayreuth for other companies, or at least bear a close resemblance.</p></blockquote>

        <p> These two heads are marked for the Mitchell Woodbury Company of Pearl Street, Boston. I haven't bee able
          to find a date for their founding, but is was obviously quite some time before the 1899 date shown here on
          their billhead (source www.historicnewengland.org). They were retailers of china and glassware, with many of
          their items coming from high end German and Silesian porcelain factories, as well as from Lamberton Works of
          New Jersey. Sometime in early 20c they moved to Atlantic Ave in Boston - and apparently they weren't the most
          scrupulous of Boston firms since I have found records of a successful 1930's suit brought against them
          by Albert Pick-Broth Co. for their actions in not only hiring away employees but encouraging them to being
          their customer lists and production information. This suit ultimately made it all the way to the Supreme Court. Mitchell
          Woodbury was apparently active until the early 1940s.</p>

Neither of these was marked; both were sold as Royal Bayreuth but my suspicions are that since they don't have the RB mark they were made for some other importer - perhaps MW since the cow on the right is from the same mold as the black ones from them. </p></blockquote>

          <p> Here are two more heads that bear a resemblance to the Royal Bayreuth creamers. The “Blackpool” crested
            one (which is in the same series as the 3 similar to it that are shown in the Ads and Souvenirs Theme) has
            the “foreign” in a circle stamp, typical of imports to the UK, and seems to me to be very similar to those from
            the Royal Bayreuth molds. The gaudy one on the right is unmarked, but obviously from a different mold.</p>

            but for the 'Made in Taiwan' sticker on the base of the bisque white one. Both are really very well made,

            collection and this was her favorite. They are no longer quite so cheap.  I also believe that they were
            made in just these three sizes, and it has taken me many years to acquire one of each.<u></u><u></u></p>

          <p>Here’s another German bull, this time with both head and tail mounted on a vase shaped container.  I would
            guess it to be early 20c. Although it’s not marked for Germany it does have a mold number near the base,
            and that plus the quality and humor are a pretty good indication of its provenance. </p>

          <p>Moving off the continent to the UK, this beautiful Fresian and Jersey hail from Quail Ceramics of Church
            Lane, Deal, Kent, whose web site notes that they have been in the giftware business for over 20 years, and
            have their designs made by small family businesses in Thailand. Quail is best known for their animals,
            birds, and especially (ugh!) cats…they have a range of named cats called “The Moggies” that apparently are
            quite popular, although why anyone would be the least interested in collecting ceramic cats is completely
            beyond me. Cow creamers of course are quite a different story. Of these two, the Fresian came first, and
            bears a simple “Q” as the makers mark on its base, while the Jersey’s mark reads “Quail, 2010”. Perhaps
            others will follow. </p>

            identical, albeit the white one is ceramic and the black one is made from the red clay typical of Jackfield
            creamers, and indeed has the Jackfield glaze with gold highlights.  These were both quite expensive and the
            shipping prices from the UK were high, but they are sufficiently lovely as well as unusual that I couldn’t
            resist them.  Thankfully the sellers packed well and they made it here unscathed.</p>

              <p>These vintage Japanese cow head creamers with curls o0n their foreheads come up -
              at least some of them do - fairly often on ebay.  There are small variations in the
              color and number of bells among those in the left hand picture, and in the right hand
              one the center cow with crossed eyes is flanked by a couple that appear to have acorn
              shaped bells.</p></blockquote>
