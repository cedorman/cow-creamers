                <p> The nicest of the head creamers are the porcelain ones made by Royal Bayreuth – these come in a
                  variety of colors; the photo of four creamers was also shown in the Favorite Brands theme, but it is
                  repeated here as a lead-in both to others by Royal Bayreuth, and to some ‘look-alike’ copies.  These
                  four – actually two cows and two water buffalo – bear the Royal Bayreuth, Bavaria stamp. The other
                  two cows are impressed Deponiert (as are some of the ones with the Royal Bayreuth stamp) but without
                  the crest.</p>

          <p>Here are three more nice examples of Royal Bayreuth cow or bull head creamers. To reiterate a bit of
            what’s in the Favorite Brands section, Royal Bayreuth has been produced in the same factory in Tettau,
            Bavaria, since 1794. They have used a number of different marks, usually including the Bavarian coat of
            arms, two lions rampant and a shield. The crest, name Royal Bayreuth and Bavaria were used from 1870-1919,
            and some later ones may say Germany or even U.S.Zone from 1945-49. Many made for export also bear an
            impressed 'Deponiert' which in English translates to deposited. Next, here are some that were either made
            by Royal Bayreuth for oither companies, or at least bear a close resemblance.</p>

        <p> These two heads are marked for the Mitchell Woodbury Company of Pearl Street, Boaston. I haven't bee able
          to find a date for their founding, but is was obviously quite some time before the 1899 date shown here on
          their billhead (source www.historicnewengland.org). They were retailers of china and glassware, with many of
          their items coming from high end German and Silesian porcelain factories, as well as from Lamberton Works of
          New Jersey. Sometime in early 20c they moved to Atlantic Ave in Boston - and apparently weren't the most
          scrupulous of Boston firms since there I have found records of a successful 1930's suit brought against them
          by Albert Pick-Broth Co. for their actions in not only hiring away employees but encourtaging them to being
          their customer lists and production information. This suit ultimetely made it to the Supreme Court. Mitchell
          Woodbury was apparently active until the early 1940s.</p>

          <p> Here are two more heads that bear a resemblance to the Royal Bayreuth creamers. The “Blackpool” crested
            one (which is in the same series as the 3 similar to it that are shown in the Ads and Souvenirs Theme) has
            the “foreign” in a circle stamp, typical of imports to the UK, and seems to me very similar to those from
            the Royal Bayreuth molds. The gaudy one on the right is unmarked, but obviously from a different mold.</p>

            copies or at least similar versions. These two lovely examples could easily be mistaken for Royal Bayreuth,
            but for the 'Made in Taiwan' sticker on the base of the bisque white one. Both are really very well made,
            and considerably less expensive than their Bavarian cousins. </p>

            came with a note that said his mother purchased it in 1909…for fifty cents! She had a large creamer
            collection and this was her favorite. They are no longer quite so cheap.  I also believe that they were
            made in just these three sizes, and it has taken me many years to acquire one of each.<u></u><u></u></p>

          <p>Here’s another German bull, this time with both head and tail mounted on a vase shaped container.  I would
            guess it to be early 20c. Although it’s not marked for Germany it does have a mold number near the base,
            and that plus the quality and humor are a pretty good indication of its provenance. </p>

            Lane, Deal, Kent, whose web site notes that they have been in the giftware business for over 20 years, and
            have their designs made by small family businesses in Thailand. Quail is best known for their animals,
            birds, and especially (ugh!) cats…they have a range of named cats called “The Moggies” that apparently are
            quite popular, although why anyone would be the least interested in collecting ceramic cats is completely
            beyond me. Cow creamers of course are quite a different story. Of these two, the Fresian came first, and
            bears a simple “Q” as the makers mark on its base, while the Jersey’s mark reads “Quail, 2010”. Perhaps
            others will follow. </p>

          <p>Here are two very unusual and quite large English creamers from the early to mid 19c. The molds are
            identical, albeit the white one is ceramic and the black one is made from the red clay typical of Jackfield
            creamers, and indeed has the Jackfield glaze with gold highlights.  These were both quite expensive and the
            shipping prices from the UK were high, but they are sufficiently lovely as well as unusual that I couldn’t
            resist them.  Thankfully the sellers packed well and they made it here unscathed.</p>

            creamer on the far left above.  Like it, they are simply stamped “Japan” (black and white cow) or “Made in
            Japan” (brown cows)</p>

          <p> These two both have ‘voice boxes’ fitted into the bottom, so that they should ‘moo’ when tipped up.  I
            say ‘should’ moo, but they seem to have a bad case of laryngitis, presumably from a combination of age and
            repeated use.  I have yet to find one where the ‘moo-er’ actually works.</p>

          <p> The two brown creamers shown here both came from the UK (via eBay).  The seller of the one on the left
            said that he had dug it out of a ‘1920-1930’s tip’.  The blue one in the middle came from Australia</p>

              and frequently show up on ebay listed as cow creamers. At least they're inexpensive and not offensive.</p>

            somewhat different interpretation, perhaps meant to be a cow buffalo. These are both
            marked “Made in Occupied Japan”, so the buffalo head mold has been around for quite some

            these are often sold as cow creamers, but I suspect that they were originally designed
            to hold mustard or some other condiment.</p>
