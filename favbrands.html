          <h1>Favorite Brands</h1>
		  
          <p>Many  ‘modern’ creamers (and teapots, and pitchers, etc) have stickers or marks which identify their
            makers, and I’ve tried to identify them in the appropriate theme section.  Here I’m featuring just a few
            factories or brands, selected either because I have quite a number of their cows in my collection, or
            because their brand names are quite well known, or just because I personally find them pretty special.</p>
			
          <p>There are two makers or cow creamers that I like best of all.  The first of these is <strong>Goebel</strong>
            of (West) Germany, perhaps best known for their Hummel figurines (yes, I have some Hummels --inherited from
            my Grandmother -- but they don’t pass muster for this collection).  Goebel seems to have made quite a
            number of cow creamers and pitchers over the years (they bear a number of different Goebel marks, from the
            Crown through various bees), some realistic, others fanciful.  I would hope that some serious Goebel
            collector can perhaps tell me how many cow creamers and pitchers they have actually produced – I’ve tried
            the web and a number of books, but without success.  I will start this page with their cow creamers.</p>
			
			<p> The second of my favorite makers is (or are) <strong>Schafer and Vater </strong> (S&V) of Rudolstadt, Germany. Their cow (and other animal) creamers follow the Goebels.  There's a bit more about them at the start of that section.</p>

              <td>
                <p>From the number of these that come available on eBay, they seem to be the most common of the Goebel
                  cow creamers.  The smaller version of the standing creamer has a matching sugar bowl, but I’ve never
                  found one for the larger creamer.  This model has also been used fairly widely for souvenirs.</p>

              <td>
                <p>These Goebel caricatures of a cow with a large back opening and outsized udder (must be
                  uncomfortable) are also fairly common, and were popular as a souvenir…at least at Niagara Falls. 
                  They all bear the Large V bee, used by Goebel from 1950-1955. The two with brown spots also say
                  “Germany” which implies they were made for sale in the US, which requires country of origin
                  markings.  The matte white one has the Goebel mark on a hoof along with “Foreign”. That term was
                  initially used for German products sold in the UK after WWI, but this one is too modern for that so I
                  don’t know the reason for the designation. Maybe again UK though, since there was unlikely to be much
                  love for German products there for quite some time after WWII.</p>

                <p>Many of the Goebel creamers have apparently been copied by other manufacturers. The smaller of the
                  brown and white ones in the first picture has many close ‘relatives’, and I have a couple of the
                  outsized-udder ones that are unmarked and quite similar to the Goebels.  Here’s a third example – the
                  cow on the left is marked for “Goebel, W. Germany” and came to me from an eBay seller in the UK.  I
                  bought the other two on a trip to Germany; the middle one is
                  marked “Made in W. Germany”, and the one on the right – that has some extra ceramic on the neck – is
                  unmarked. The ‘original’ has the horns and ears separated while they’re merged in the copies. </p>

                <p><strong>Schafer and Vater </strong>(S&V) is my other favorite brand.  Gustav Schafer and Gunther Vater
                  founded their factory in Volkstedt Rudolstadt, Thuringa, Germany in 1890, to produce high quality
                  porcelain. In 1896 they purchased the List Porcelain Factory at Neuhaus, and by 1910 Sears Roebuck
                  Company began to import and distribute Schafer & Vater pottery into the US. In 1913 Paul Schafer took
                  over from his father and, working alongside Gunther Vater, built up a successful workforce of around
                  200 people, using 3 kilns. In 1918 the factory was destroyed by fire and they set up a new factory to
                  resume production. I have been told by a knowledgeable S&V collector that after this time they made
                  only utilitarian items, so presumably all my fanciful animal creamers came from the first factory,
                  and likely were made prior to WWI. The firm closed in 1962, and it’s believed that the East German
                  government assumed control of the vacant factory in 1972, and all records and molds were destroyed.
                  Schafer & Vater are well-known for comical and figural items, as well as jugs, creamers, miniature
                  liquor bottles for distribution by pubs, special advertising runs for clients, figurines, match
                  strikers, hair holders, “naughties”, hat pin holders, and planters. Their impressed mark is a crown
                  above an 'R' in a star, although it wasn’t always used and frequently is indistinct. A characteristic
                  of their pottery is the fine texture of the locally mined clay that was rich in kaolin and yielded
                  pottery with velvety texture and very fine grain.  There are a number of S&V collectors featured on
                  the web. I have stayed strictly with their dressed-up animal creamers, but I like their work so much
                  that I have succumbed to a number of their other animals in addition to cows, as you will see.</p>

                <p>These creamers (at least the two on the right), although unmarked, are almost assuredly S&V by virtue
                  of style, material, and detail such as on the skirt. fAlso I found one on eBay that was offered from an estate
                  of someone who collected only S&V, and there is a blue as well as colored version. They do have
                  illegible numbers around the base.  The one on the left is a heavier ceramic, not porcelain, and
                  lacks the fine features of the other two.  A very knowledgeable S&V expert, Cody (Al McQueen) was
                  kind enough to suggest that it is probably from the same area (Rudolstadt) since many factories made
                  similar items and artists moved around.  He also noted that S&V stopped making figural novelties like
                  these shortly after WW1, and from then until they closed in the 1960s made only utilitarian forms.
                  This certainly helps with the dating.</p>

                <p>Eventually I did manage to find a colored version of this comical S&&V cow, which I bought via
                  eBay from Sweden.  A year or so later, I was delighted to acquire a similar one – basically the same
                  cow, but a quite different pitcher and milkmaid – this time from the Isle of Jersey!  I believe these
                  are quire rare, both because they’re the only ones I have ever seen, and because the bidding on them
                  was quite fierce. I prevailed, but at some cost! They’re great examples of the S&V sense of
                  humor, combined with very high quality pottery.  Now that I have three of these, I’m naturally
                  wondering how many more variations there are.</p>

                <p>This orange pig came to me from Manchester England, and the seller said he got it from a dealer in
                  Scotland.  At first I was quite excited because it’s of thicker and heavier porcelain than all the
                  other S&&V animal creamers, and has a rim around the back opening as well as an unglazed rim on a
                  recessed, glazed bottom.
				  It does bear the S&V mark (partial) as well as a mold number, so I
                  thought for sure it must be one of theirs, revealing a different manufacturing technique.  But it
                  turns out, <strong>NOT SO!</strong> Sometime later I saw what looked like an S&V creamer offered
                  on eBay with a cautionary note to buyers that it was a reproduction.  The seller pointed to the <a
                    href="http://www.keralouve.com/">www.keralouve.com</a> web site, of the Mundial Company. of
                  Belgium.  So I looked there and sure enough – among a lot of other reproductions of many different makers
                  was this pig, their stock No. HR780.  These folks only sell to vendors, so apparently feel they can pass off their products
                  and let others take the hit for falsifying origin. Or maybe some folks just like reproduction pottery, since it can be a lot cheaper than originals, just as with paintings. As noted above, all the S&V molds had been
                  destroyed by the East Germans. Turns out this pig is a recast - the thickness comes from their having
                  used an original to create a new mold.  Coloration, glaze, etc. also differ from the original. It seems
                  I now have to be more careful when acquiring S&V (and other older) items, particularly because
                  I’ve noticed these types of reproductions showing up on eBay more frequently.  Whether the chap in
                  Manchester or the person he got it from in Scotland knew it was a reproduction I have no way of
                  knowing -  but having been fooled once (to the tune of £62) I will now be more careful, and take
                  advantage of eBay’s buyer protection policy should I get ‘bit’ again.  I have also had the opportunity to warn anoither seller who tried to sell one of these as S&V. </p>

                  the S&V one. I normally would have passed them up, but wanted to find out who made the ones that are
                  so similar to S&V.  It turns out that they aren’t even German, but rather bear the mark of “The
                  Horchow Collection”, as well as “Made in England”.  Naturally I dashed to Wikipedia, finding that
                  “Samuel Roger Horchow (born July 3, 1928 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a catalog entrepreneur and Broadway
                  producer…In 1971, Horchow started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Horchow_Collection&action=edit&redlink=1"

                  successful Broadway plays, and is the author of three books. I wonder if he realizes that somewhere
                  along the line he (or maybe Nieman Marcus?) copied S&V? </p>

                  I’m not aware that they ever made any full-bodied cow creamers, but they have produced a line of cow, bull,   and water buffalo head creamers and pitchers, like the three shown here.  As far as I know these are the only three forms of 'cow' head creamers/pitchers they made, but they come in a myriod of colors. Also, their style has been rather widely copied. There are more examples, including some of the 'copies',  in the

                <p><strong>Fitz & Floyd.   </strong>If I had to pick a third favorite, this US brand company would
                  qualify.  In great American entrepreneurial fashion you have to dig for anything about them on their
                  web site since it’s basically a sales outlet.  They’ve been in business since @1960, with studios in
                  Dallas and production wherever they can get a good deal (China, Taiwan mostly), or so it seems to
                  me.  They make “handpainted ceramic giftware, tableware, decorative assortments, home fragrance and
                  collectibles”, which I interpret as meaning just about anything ceramic that will sell, plus a bunch of other stuff..  Occasionally
                  they go through spurts of popular themes, and for a while in the 90’s produced a number of quite
                  lovely cow items.  Go to the Christmas theme, for example, to see their superb “Eight Maids a’ 
                  Milking” pitcher.  Here I feature just two of their cow ‘collections’ – </p>

                  cows from the studio of Tom Hatton, dated (l-r) 1994, 91, and 93. His studio is located
                  in Bonita, CA…On his web site, <a href="http://www.tomhattonceramics.com/">http://www.tomhattonceramics.com/</a>,
                  his wife Diane tells us a bit about him:   “Tom was born in Hawaii in 1944 to a Portuguese mother and
                  a farm boy father from Georgia. Growing up barefoot on the beaches of Waikiki was an idyllic
                  beginning followed by a year on the farm where he developed a passion for grits and huge hogs. He
                  grew up in San Diego and attended San Diego State College receiving first his BA and then his MA in
                  sculpture with a master's show featuring among other things, the Bank of America on the back of a
                  pig. (It was during the Vietnam War.) He married me, Diane Chase, and taught art classes
                  part-time at San Diego State and the various local junior colleges. We had two children,
                  Carlson and Alana, and I taught elementary school. In 1983, we were introduced to the American Craft
                  Council shows and Tom found a ready audience for his work in galleries and stores across the
                  country.  While it forced him to be a little more commercial than he would have liked, it served
                  us well, enabling us to work together and put the children through school. In 1995, we chose to let
                  the people who had worked for us, seven of them at the busiest, go on to other things and we pared
                  the line down so that Tom was not doing so much repetition and more one-of-a-kind work.  It is
                  still exciting and he's always working on something new. He still never talks about what he is
                  making and it is always a surprise when I see a completed work.&nbsp; It's fun.”  You can see more of
                  Tom’s cow pieces on the Teapots page. </p>

                  lady from whom I acquired it stated that she bought it directly from Tom’s wife Diane when she was
                  cleaning out his workshop. I believe it is one-of-a-kind, and comes from when he was developing his
                  approach to cows, finally settling on the style of the ones above.  For those of you that appreciate

                  Stamford, Connecticut, an importer that was started in 1948 by John and Robert Howard and A. Grant
                  Holt. They focused on whimsical kitchen items and giftware, and are probably best known for their
                  ‘pixiware’. They were bought out by General Housewares Corporation in 1969, but the HH name was
                  apparently retained until production ceased in 1990. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.collectics.com/education_pixieware.html">http://www.collectics.com/education_pixieware.html</a>.
                  Pixiware was so popular that other companies started to copy it. One of these companies was <strong>Lipper
                  & Mann</strong>, who are responsible for the funny cow set on the right. According to the web site for
                  Lipper International – Lipper bought out Mann in 1963 and changed the name – they were organized in
                  1946 on 5th Ave, NY, as an importer of glass and ceramics from Czechoslovakia and other European
                  companies. They started importing from Japan in 1947, which is where these (and the teapot set shown
                  in that section) came from. Mr Lipper passed on in 2002 but the company is still going strong, now as
                  a wholesaler of wooden items and, among other things, ‘Lipperware’. </p>

                  “George Zoltan <strong>Lefton </strong>was a Hungarian immigrant who arrived in Chicago in 1939. Although his
                  background was in marketing and designing specialty clothing, he had a passion for collecting fine
                  porcelain. The Lefton Company was founded in 1941 … he traveled to Japan in 1945 to seal an importing
                  agreement and the first Lefton China product marked &quot;Made in Occupied Japan&quot; reached the
                  United States in 1946… The Lefton Company was purchased by OMT Enterprises in 2005 and moved to
                  California”.  Lefton made cups, pitchers, etc in this cow-shaped form, and they not only were popular
                  themselves, but have been quite widely copied.  There are a number of examples elsewhere in the
                  collection.</p>

                <p>The Lenox Corporation web site has a nice ‘about us’ section that tells a lot about its proud
                  history. It starts: “In 1889, founder Walter Scott Lenox had the confidence and passion to pursue his
                  vision of creating "the finest American porcelain dinnerware" with a start-up company that operated
                  for several years on a shoestring budget. In the early years, his persistence and determination led
                  to the company's success. Demand for his unique and artistic American porcelain products steadily
                  grew and, 125 years later, the Lenox brand continues to be the most trusted tabletop name in the U.S.
                  market. Today, our bone china is still manufactured in the U.S., at our Kinston, North Carolina
                  facility.” While many potteries have changed hands or closed over the years, Lenox is not only a
                  survivor but a gobbler with an apparently huge appetite. These days, The Lenox Corporation includes
                  among its brands Dansk, Gorham, Reed & Barton, Kate Spade New York and The French Chefs as well as
                  Lenox. </p></blockquote>

                    of London </strong>.  That was a new word to me, so first I looked it up and found that my huge
                  Webster’s unabridged says that yes it is indeed obsolete, but that it means ‘select, choice,
                  excellent’.  The blue Eximious logo goes a bit further, claiming ‘Excellent, Distinguished,
                  Elegant’.  Dr Bill Long’s Spellers Diary gives a somewhat fuller explication:  “When the Puritans
                  began to publish their voluminous sermons and theological treatises in the 17th
                    century, they bequeathed to the English language not only a peculiar Scripture-centered piety that has been rediscovered by many in our day, but they
                  discovered (or invented) lots of words to capture the fullness and transformative power of the Gospel
                  that they preached… one of their words, <em><em>eximious</em></em>, [was] used by the greats such as
                  John Owen and John Flavel, and meaning ‘excellent, distinguished, or eminent.’ Granted,
                  the OED says that it was a common term in 17th century literature which assumed a rather pedantic
                  meaning in the 19th (see the discussion of <em><em>esurient </em></em>in a previous essay), but I was
                  impressed through some quick internet searches of the way it is used in connection with the ‘<em><em>eximious</em> </em>way
                  of the Cross’or ’<em><em>eximious</em> </em>expression of love’ by the Puritan preachers.”   See
                  what you can learn from the bottom of a cow? Incidentally, the <a href="http://www.eximious.com/"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.eximious.com</a> web site notes that “Josephine Louis, founder
                  and Chairwoman, discovered the charming and elegant shop called Eximious during the time she lived in
               England in the 1980's. Famous for gifts and monogrammed
                  accessories - the Belgravia shop so thoroughly inspired Mrs. Louis that she decided to start a
                  catalogue and shop in the United States. Twenty four years later, Eximious of London
                  has become synonymous with the understated good taste and elegance of British traditions and is
                  justly proud of a clientele in numerous countries…Eximious' well-deserved reputation is the result of
                  a tireless quest throughout Europe and the world by Mrs. Louis and
                  her staff, who travel for months in pursuit of the select collection of treasures which she is so
                  delighted to share with you.”  </p>

                  “J. Beswick (pronounced BESS-wik) started his Staffordshire pottery around 1894 making dinnerware and
                  such ornamental ceramics as the then ubiquitous Staffordshire cats and dogs. Most were unmarked and
                  are hard to tell from their competitors’.”   In 1934 descendents John Ewart and Gilbert Beswick
                  introduced high fired bone china figurines of “unmatched quality and detail” first featuring animals
                  in humorous settings, and then under ceramicist Arthur Gredington they started using named breed
                  champions as models. Their champion horses, dogs, and cows were very famous and popular (and
                  expensive). In 1969, having run out of heirs to run the firm, the family sold out to Royal
                  Doulton. I’m sure that there is a story to accompany these ‘creamers’; they are actually ‘models’ or
                  satires of creamers, and have no mouth holes. They were designed by Graham Tongue, and were made from
                  1982-89, Model #2792.  The one with the yellow flowers seems to be the most common, but as seen here
                  there are also blue and purple versions (and maybe more??).</p>

                <p>The <strong>Emma Bridgewater</strong> line of china includes cow creamers in several of their patterns.  They have
                  recently been reintroduced, presumably in time for Christmas ’07 shopping, albeit they bear (for some
                  reason that truly puzzles me) a warning that they are not intended for food use.  Given their price
                  (£50 from their web site, often much more on ebay!) this seems truly strange and inappropriate. Be that as it may, I of course
                  needed one of each pattern that they make…they and a bit of Emma's story are on page 3 of Modern Variations, along with a couple
                  collector’s versions.</p>

                  <strong>“Kent”</strong> cow creamers bearing the knot logo, like the ones on the right and center in this photo, date
                  from 1944-1962 (when the factory stopped making them) and were produced from 19th century molds. The
                  Museum of Pottery and Art in Stoke on Trent (home of the fabulous Keiller collection of Staffordshire
                  cow creamers) has reproduced some in various colors (with the knot logo) for sale exclusively at
                  their gift shop; the creamer with the green country scene on the left is one of those.  William Kent
                  initially established his factory in Burselm in 1878, and produced ‘Old Staffordshire’ style pottery
                  from even older molds.  The early Kent versions, as well as those that predate his operation or have
                  been reproduced more recently, are unmarked.  They come in a wide range of colors and decorations,
                  both on bases and free standing.  All however have lids. See Jim Hurford’s website <a rel="nofollow"

                  examples of older ‘Kent’ type creamers in the Staffordshire theme. </p>

                <p><strong> To conclude this page, here is one last favorite European company.</strong></p>
                <p>This is <strong>Villeroy & Boch’s</strong> “Happy Farm” cow, the only modern one that they have made as far as I
                  know. . Wikipedia tells us that the company that because V&B “began in the tiny Lorraine village of
                  Audun le Tiche, where the iron master François Boch set up a pottery company with his three sons in
                  1748. In 1766 Boch was licensed to build a ceramics kilnworks nearby at Septfontaines, Luxembourg,
                  where it operated a porcelain factory. In 1785 Nicolas Villeroy became sole owner of the faience
                  manufactory at Wallerfangen. In 1812 Jean-François Boch began construction of kilns at the nearby
                  town of Mettlach, Saarland. In 1824 Boch commenced transfer printing on porcelain from engraved
                  copper plates. On 14 April 1836, the Jean François Boch company merged with that of the competitor,
                  Nicolas Villeroy, and became Villeroy & Boch, (V&B, also simply 'VB'). Since 1869, when Villeroy &
                  Boch opened the first manufactory specializing in architectural tiles, the company has operated in
                  three main areas, autonomous until 1982, tablewares, tiles for flooring and revetments, and fine
                  plumbing fixtures…The company's Luxembourg factory was closed down in 2010. While the company is no
                  longer run by a family member, under the present Group Chairman Frank Goering, there are various
                  family members currently working in the company. Since 1990 the company… has been listed on the
                  German stock market but the voting capital is still in the hands of the family descendants.” These
                  days V&B is worldwide but has its broadest market in Germany. For a detailed history of its founding
                  and development over the past 250 plus years, go to
                  www.villeroyboch-group.com/en/company/our-stories/history.html. I have a four lovely souvenir cow
                  creamers made by V&B in Luxembourg, presumably in early 20c, that are shown on the Advertising And
                  Souvenirs page. </p>
