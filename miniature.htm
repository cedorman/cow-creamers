    <p>Where does one draw the line for miniatures?  Well, doll-house size, 1/12 scale (or  smaller) creamers clearly qualify.  I’ve  also chosen to place some slightly larger ones in this category, largely based  on the fact that many of them seem too tiny to effectively serve as real  creamers, at least for more than a skimpy serving for a very small person.  And, this is a mixture of creamers and  teapots. </p>

                  <p>Doll House (1/12 scale) : I  have found two types of these; the first is ones made
                    from china or porcelain, like this ‘tea set’ and the very similar but slightly
                    larger separate ‘teapot’;&nbsp; their lids are the tops of their heads and  horns.&nbsp; I
                    have seen the set on eBay, but I bought mine from the very delightful Black
                    Butterfly Shop on Royal Street in New Orleans in 2000.&nbsp; This shop is run  by Myra
                    Landry and her brother Norbert, the 3rd generation of their family to operate  it. 
                    It survived Katrina, but according to a Washington Post article from their web
                    page, business hasn’t been the same since. The separate cow came from the UK by eBay. I don’t know the maker of either of them.  </p>

              <p>Here is a very special and quite old hand made dollhouse  size Staffordshire style creamer.  The  seller stated that she discovered it hidden behind the curtains of the  Nantucket  (MA) Fletcher house.  She notes that there is mention in the museum  documentation that it is from Holland and from the 1880s, possibly  earlier.  I do believe that the Holland  attribution is correct, from the sketch of what looks very much like a Dutch  girl on the base.  She goes on to state  that “This cow creamer was a part of a beautiful Dollhouse created by Cara Van  Campen Fletcher, born in 1902. This magnificent house is a copy of the original  Fletcher House still standing in Nantucket and built by the Fletcher Family in  the 1830s. The estate, farm and caretaker’s cottage was gifted to the Flint  Museum of Arts in Michigan in 1957 and Deaccessioned in 2010. The original  house measures 58” in length, is three stories tall, ten rooms and a widow’s  walk on the roof. The main house was originally built in the 1920’s, Mrs. Van  Campen-Fletcher had it shipped to her in 1950 from Nantucket and began the  painstaking work of completing the house, farm and caretaker’s cottage”. This  creamer is one of several hundred pieces from the dollhouse.</p></td>

              Rachel Williams, who themselves design and make a beautiful line of
              Staffordshire-inspired (like these creamers) and other porcelain doll house
              miniatures. They’re located in Bwlchygarreg, Pontdolgoch, Caersws, Powys, UK  (quite
              a mouthful).&nbsp; They have a great web site, and do superb workmanship.&nbsp;  &nbsp;The brown
              creamer on the quarter on the left came from Little Obsessions in Commak, NJ.  Their
              web site seems a bit dated, but indicated that they sell doll house miniatures  made
              by artisans from around the world; this cow is signed “SM” but with no other

Indeed, I had no ides  how many varieties there were until I visited <a href="http://www.epiphany-figures.com/">www.epiphany-figures.com</a>, which  takes you to “Faboland – Jean-Marie Collections”.

                  These fanciful wild  eyed creamers with front and back legs both glued together side to side are all  from Japan,  and probably date to the late 1940s or early 1950s.  Lots of variations on essentially the same  idea, and most likely from the same maker.   Note that one of them has a souvenir decal, now somewhat obliterated.</p>
