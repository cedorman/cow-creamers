          <h1>Silver</h1>
		  
		  <p> My collection has close to a hundred silver cow creamers, ranging in age from two by John Schuppe dated 1764 and 1768, to a few from the late 20c and early 21c. Silver cow creamers  aren't all that rare, but they are getting quite expensive so I am very careful about which ones I buy. They seem to remain fairly popular thanks in part to P.G. Wodehouse's 1938 book, <em>The Code of the Woosters</em> and the related 1990s TV serial about Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves, in which the first episode of the second series was <em>Jeeves Saves the Cow-Creamer</em>. I also believe that although my overall cow creamer collection is one of if not the largest in the world, there are likely several collections of silver cow creamers (and the old Staffordshire cow creamers) that are larger than mine. </p>
		  
          <p>I have a few that I commissioned, although most of these were just made for the 'trade', most probably by working the silver around a mold.  For an introduction to the traditional method of crafting a cow creamer (now seldom used), by carefully hammering out the body by hand,  view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHAsvy8LXsg"
              target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHAsvy8LXsg</a> from the workshop of master
            silversmith Bruce Russell of Guernsey.  You can find more about him, and the cow he made for me (Snowflake) , at the
            beginning of the “Other Silver Cow Creamers” area which is about 3/5 of the way down this page.</p>

                <p><a href="silver/05s1hairyettetmarks.JPG"></a><strong>Silver Cow Creamers and John Schuppe</strong><br>
                  From C. Bernhard Hughes’ fine historical accounts in his 1957 book <em>Small Antique Silverware</em>,
                  we learn that “A quaint conceit of the third quarter of the eighteenth century was the milk jug
                  modeled in the form of a cow.  Although the name of John Schuppe” (a Dutch silversmith who moved to
                  London ~1750 and registered his mark there in 1753) “is particularly associated with these jugs there
                  is evidence of hall-marks that David Willaume the younger” (a Hugenot silversmith, 1693-1761) “was
                  making them before Schuppe, who remains an obscure figure, dying in 1773.  Silver cows, as they were
                  listed at the assay office, were made in sections. The sides of the head and body were made
                  separately as were legs and hooves, horns, ears, and the tail handle which looped upward over the
                  haunches. The top of the hollow body was fitted with a curved hinged lid, like a saddle, either plain
                  or bordered with chased flowers and foliage, and with a lifting knob in the form of a large fly
                  modeled in the round. The jug was filled through the lidded opening, the milk being poured into the
                  tea-cup from the animal’s mouth.  Head and body might be tooled to represent the cow’s hair, but
                  others were left smooth-surfaced except for some tool work representing hair between horns and eyes,
                  and along the back bone, this being applied with the intention of concealing joints…Silver cows
                  approximate 4 inches in height; an example by Schuppe sold at Christie’s weighed 4 oz, 15 dwt. In
                  modeling, as in general design, the style is naïve but lively.  Many were gilded and a crest might be
                  engraved on the side of the body.  In some instances the neck was engraved with an inscribed collar.”</p>
				  
                <p>I would like to thank Peter Cameron, a London silversmith (of Vault 57 in the London Silver Vaults)
                  for some additional information about John Schuppe, whom it seems is really quite hard to pin down. 
                  He notes that there were some Schuppes of German origin in London at that time, so the assumption
                  that silversmith Schuppe of the cows was Dutch may indeed be mistaken.   Our elusive silversmith
                  apparently worked in the liberty (an area in which rights reserved to the king had been devolved into
                  private hands) of St Martin’s le Grand (at first in Little Dean's Court and then in New Rents), which
                  is located in the City of London between Newgate Street and Cheapside to the south, and Aldersgate
                  Street to the north.  Mr Cameron stated in an email to me dated May 2012 that “I am pretty clear that
                  John Schuppe, the silversmith, had a wife named Mary and that they had a son, John, who was born in
                  1760 and died in 1823. He was listed as a watchmaker, hardware and toyman in an insurance policy with
                  the Sun Insurance Company in 1804. This last John Schuppe had no children. There were daughters of
                  John, the silversmith, and Mary his wife, as follows: Elizabeth, who married a John Phillips in 1782
                  and had a son named John Schuppe Phillips; Ann christened 1754 of whom no more as yet; and Mary who
                  married Mathew Hodson in 1781 and had various children. John Schuppe, silversmith, was certainly
                  alive quite late in the year 1773 but his wife, Mary, (then living in London Wall), wrote her will in
                  1795 when she described herself as a widow. The only hope of finding more detail is combing through
                  the rate books for the period - if I can find the Schuppes listed in them and if they survive.”  He
                  was also kind enough to pass on the following fascinating clipping from the “Gazetteer and London
                  Daily Advertiser” (London), Monday, February 23, 1756; Issue 4504: </p>

                 side,front, top and butt  views, along with their hallmarks: Schuppe’s JS, the lion rampant denoting
                  silver, the leopard head with crown which is the early London assay mark, and the date stamp, here
                  1764 for the smooth creamer (Hairiette) and 1768 for the chased one (Hairy).  </p></blockquote>

                <p>The fly on the lid – flies being pervasive around cows and milking (and not as disparaged then as
                  now, I’ve heard) – has become traditional on silver creamers, as you will see on much of the rest of
                  the collection; and the scrawny legs have also carried on through the years; butts, however, are a
                  different story, and  differ widely. Schuppe’s seem somewhat more realistic than many others. </p>
				  
                <p>I’d like to learn more about John Schuppe and about David Willaume II and his creamers as well, if
                  someone can kindly point me to a source.  <a href="http://www.ukauctioneers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.UKauctioneers.com</a>
                  has a very nice glossary (that they attribute to Reader’s Digest’s “Treasures in your Home”) that
                  notes that “David Willaume I (1658-1741) [was a] huguenot silversmith who worked in London using many
                  techniques and designs which were far advanced. His pieces are individualistic … His son David
                  Willaume II (1693 -1761) took over the business in 1716. For a time the two silversmiths were thought
                  to be one and the same”.  There is nothing about Schuppe, however.</p></blockquote>

He made the mold, did the pressing and assembling and had them polished, chased and assayed. These are very close copies of Schuppe's originals - hard to tell the difference except for the marks. For comparison I show the same shots as of the originals. I purchased these two lovely cow creamers from Veronica Shaw who named them Daisy and Doris (and from who I later commissioned Bluebell and Dalina, see below.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Another Schuppe copy, not that I really needed one … but I was curious about its possible maker
                  and age and it was reasonably priced. The only marks are under the lid – “xxx” in an oval, and two
                  unidentifiable symbols. There are quite a number of Dutch silversmiths who used xxx as their mark,
                  generally with some other symbol added, so I assume (proibably incorrectly)  it’s from Holland. The only one I could find that
                  used just the letters in the shape this one has is Diederik Willem Rethmeyer who worked in Amsterdam
                  in the early 1800s.  This cow is shiny and looks new – and was relatively inexpensive as these things
                  go, so I doubt it’s by him – presumably some enterprising chap is turning them out in large numbers
                  given their continuing popularity.  One distinctive feature that differentiates it from my other schulle copies if the smooth unfunctional rear end.</p></blockquote>

                  provenance, I’d guess it to be quite modern, and likely English because of its weight.</p>

Pretty obviously I liked this form of cow creamers, albeit I didn’t tumble to the fact that they are triplets until well after I had purchased them.  Eah of them bears a somewhat interesting tale, which I relate below shots of their belly marks. They also seems to have marks uon the inside of their lids, but I wasn't able to get a clear shot - I believe they are simply the lion passant standerd and the Elizabeth II leopard head.</p>

			<p>This cow came to me from the shop of I. Franks in the London Silver Vaults – one of my first silver ones, and the shop here I first learned about Schuppe and sort of got hooked on higher-end cow creamers.  It’s dated 1958, and bears the marks of S. J. Shrubsole formerly of Market St London, and now E 81st St, NY.  Their web site prollaims: “Founded in London in 1912, S.J. Shrubsole opened a New York branch in 1936, under the direction of Eric N. Shrubsole. Mr. Shrubsole spent that year driving a black Packard, laden with silver and letters of introduction, to virtually every major city in America. By the time he returned a year later, he had laid the foundations for what would become one of America’s finest antique shops.Since then, we have worked with some of the world’s greatest collectors, from the serious, such as Irwin Untermyer and H.F. duPont, to the compulsive, such as Arthur Gilbert and William Randolph Hearst, to the compulsively unserious, such as Groucho Marx, who on being told that everything in the shop was antique and English, pointed his cigar at our porter and asked “even him?” We handle the greatest pieces in the world: … “ Apparently they are now simply peddlers not makers…</p>

			</p>This second of my triplets, dated 1962 bears the maker’s marks HP over LP, for Herbert and Lawrence Parsons, trading as Tessiers, Ltd. It came to me from the estate of a Yale Univ. family that was originally from Ireland.  A search for the makers turned up considerable information about Tessiers, on silvercollection.it: “The firm claims to have been established in 1812, possibly by the descendants of Etienne de Tessier, a Huguenot refugee who arrived in England in 1712, but the first information about the business are in an 1841 directory listing a Griffin & Tessier, goldsmiths and silversmiths, at 32 South Audley Street. One of the partners was Louis (Lewis) Alexander Tessier (c.1795-after 1861) who in 1851 advertised as Louis Tessier & Sons, active as artists in hair mourning jewellery at 32 Conduit Street and 32 South Audley Street. After the retirement of L.A. Tessier (1857) the business was continued by his sons Henry Thomas Louis Tessier (1816-1891) and Edward Tessier.The partnership, active also at 26 New Bond Street, was dissolved in 1869.H.T.L. Tessier continued the business at 32 South Audley Street while Edward Tessier maintained the business at 26 New Bond Street. Edward Tessier died in 1875 and the business was sold to John Gotlieu Vander and John Hedges who continued the activity under the name of E. Tessier and/or Vander & Hedges.After the dissolution of the partnership with Hedges (1900) Vander continued the activity under the same style until his death (1910). The business Edward Tessier/Vander & Hedges was continued by Arthur Martin Parsons (c.1859-1943) and Frank Herbert Parsons (died 1934) and in 1920 the firm was converted into a limited liability company under the style Tessiers Ltd. The first directors were A.M. Parsons, F.H. Parsons and S.F. Parsons. Herbert Martin Parsons (1892-1981), son of A.M. Parsons, succeeded his father as head of the firm. The firm is now active in a newly established store at 10 Burlington Arcade Piccadilly as dealers in antique and modern jewellery and silver.”  Nothing about Lawrence, but certainly a lot of otherwise good information.</p>

			<p>The third of these Schuppe-inspired cows   is marked R.C for Richard Comyns. It bears a London sterling assay mark and is dated 1968.  A search for information about it not only told me quite a bit about the some of the transitions in British silversmithing, but revealed that this model (the only one to the best of my knowledge) is currently still in routine production. Here is what I have learned (more than you may wish to know…): first, from Koopermanrareart.com (and others), the Comyns firm “was established by William Comyns c. 1859 when he purchased the business of Robert Tagg, itself said to have been founded about 1730. As yet efforts to trace the latter's lineage have failed; it seems clear, however, that Tagg succeeded John Tapley at 40 Roupell Street, Waterloo Road. Tapley, a manufacturing silversmith, was probably the last of Rundell, Bridge & Co.'s outworkers and is also known to have provided work for Robert Green & Co and Makepeace & Walford. Robert Tagg moved in 1857 to his new residence and manufactory at Carlise Street, Soho Square, where by 1859 he listed as a silversmith. William Comyns, thereafter listed as a silversmith, appears to have purchased the business in 1858 or early 1859, entering his first marks from the first same address. He moved to 1 Percy Mews, Rathbone Place, then to 16 Silver Street, Golden Square Soho, and subsequently to Beak Street, Regent Street. These premises were later expanded to 41, 43, and 45 Beak Street and to 41, 43, 45, 47 Beak Street. Additional premises were taken from c. 1903 at 54 Marshall Street, Soho.</p>
<p>The style of the firm was changed to William Comyns & Son c. 1885 when William Comyn's two sons, Charles Harling Comyns and Richard Harling Comyns were admitted to their partnership. William Comyns died in January 1916, and C.H. Comyns while attending a sale in Christie's in 1925. The business was incorporated as limited liability company as William Comyns & Sons Ltd., registered on 20th October 1930, with R.H. Comyns as permanent governing director. Upon the latter's death in 1953, when the firm is said to have lost its former prominence, William Comyns & Sons Ltd was purchased by Bernard Copping.”  From 1957 the firm was located on Tower St London WC2.  Comyns’ original mark apparently was W.C, followed by C&R after William’s death, and then R.C from @1922 to 1984, when Mr. Coping died.  I haven’t yet located any information about the fate of the firm immediately after that point, but a November 22, 2008 article in The Star stated that Comyns was acquired in 1993 by the Malaysia-owned Royal Selangor Group, and around 1998 they moved production to their plant in Wangsa Maju.  The company’s web site – http://comyns-silver.com – notes that their archives contain some 35,000 historical molds, patterns, tools, and drawings, and that they produce both traditional English and European heritage items as well as contemporary ones, with marketing targeted toward Japan, Australia and Singapore as well as Europe, US and UK.</p>
 <p>A response to my query to their Malaysian headquarters about the cow creamer – which can be found via a search on their web site and is undoubtedly fashioned from one of their historical molds – states that they trade as Comyns (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and Comyns of London. The cow creamers being produced today as a ‘standard product’ bear the W.C maker’s mark and (as of late 2015) retails in Malaysia for RM6,500. It seems I got a bargain at £480 for my 1968 version.  Another piece of information I am missing is the date when this particular mold was fashioned. I have seen quite a few Comyns cows for sale, but don’t know when – or by whom – the first was fashioned. I would be delighted if someone could help me correct and fill in the holes in this account.</p>

                <p>Here's a fourth cow creamer almost identical to the three above. This one is marked for Tiffany & Co., England and date-stamped for 1963.  It’s interesting in that it has a gold wash.  Tiffany’s produced a number of
                  creamers of this shape – I’ve even seen one with diamonds in the eyes and anus (of all things), but
                  it was a bit too rich for my taste. Interestingly, both the belly and the lid of this cow bear the
                  lion passant standard and the Elizabeth II lleopard head for the London assay, but there is no maker’s mark. 
                  Tiffany contracted with quite a few silversmiths for their products, and apparently didn’t feel it
                  important to identify them.</p>

                  Both have the lion passant with a ‘2’ below denoting .833 minimum purity silver (this mark was first

                  The one below with the curly horns, red (presumably agate) eyes and simple aft-facing fly is a bit unusual
                  in that its head is removable. Its Minerva is sort of hisdden as a flower petal on the lid, and best as I can tell it also bears an "M". Its makers mark, near the lion on the belly, is N2 and I have not been able to identify who that may be using all the available Dutch Makers Marks web sites. </p></blockquote>

			<p>This lovely little late 19c cow came to me from Paris, but it's distinctly Dutch which is  immediately apparent from the skinny Schuppe legs and the externded red agate eyes. Thanks to the sharp eyes of the seller I was able to find its marks, which as shown in more detail below are cleverly done.  The rampant lion with "2" below denoting Dutch 833 silver, confirming the coiuntry of origin, is on the belly as normal. But the 1814-1905 version of the Minerva head (I can't read the letter) is located in the center of one of the flowers on the lid. The maker's mark, an "R" over "133" for Cornelius Rietveld of Schoonhaven (1865-1912) is equally cleverly placed in the center of a flower on the other side of the lid. I think I might have miessed these if I hadn't been told where to look. Finally, there is a small mark on the tail which I believe to be the date mark, albeit I have been unable to match it up. The seller said 1870-80 which seems about right given the nature of the Minerva head and the dates that Rietveld was working.  It's great  to be able to have such good information about such a nice older cow.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Here's a second and quite different Dutch cow by Corneliun Rietveld - or so it seems since it bears the R133 maker's mark and like its friend above, has very small marks in very strange places. Seems Cornelius either had a sense of humor or was a bit of a stinker who wanted not to make it easy fon the assay office. At any rate, here he put the Minerva head on the neck of the removable head, and both the .833 purity lion symbol and his maker's mark (facing in opposite directions) on the neck of the body. Then he put the date mark - which I believe to be 1886, or at least a year from around then when they were using 'interesting' date symbols - on the outside of the knee of the left leg. Thankfully the seller (in Budapest, Hungary) had spotted all of these, because I sure had to search to find the date mark. One thing I really like about this cow is its teeth. I've only seemn such elsewhere on some of Schuppe's; and since he gave this one Schuppe-like legs, he presumably also paid tribute with the teeth.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			<p> Continuing with Dutch cow creamers from Schoonhoven, here are two marked for Herbert Hooijkaas. This seems to have been a popular name, both within the Hooijkaas family and elswehere in the country. These cows are quite similar except for size and a few minor markings. The scrawny legs are the main Schuppe-like feature - of note are the smooth butts, missing the anatomical precision of that part of the anatomy in Scupppe's and serveral of the other cows that adopted some of his stule. The larger one on the left is dated 1951 (Q), and the key next to the lion passant indicates it was made for export. The smaller one is dated 1961 (b) and does not have the key so it presumably was made for the local market. The Dutch hallmarking system changed (a bit) in 1953, so the earlier one has a "2" under the lion and the newer one a "II". Both bear the "HH" maker's mark which was used by this family business since it was founded in 1874, albeit with minor changes. This form dates from 1946. A web search turned up a bit of information about both Schoonhoven and the Hooijkaas silver firm:</p>
			<p>Schoonhoven was established in the 13c when a castle was built along the mouth of the river Zevender.  It became an important fortified city by 1330, and despite several fires , revolts, and the short Spanish occupation it prospered. Craft houses for the ‘luxury’ silver and tapestry industries developed a strong economy in the 17th and 18th centuries which seems to have lasted to the present (though with major changes to the nature of the town’s business), and today it is the smallest independent municipality in the Netherlands.  The “Schoonhovensche Zilverfabriek H. Hooijkaas” was established in the center of the town in 1874 and under several generations of the family grew from a small workshop to a factory of some 150 people. Around 1890 the company began to specialize in electrolytic manufacturing of old Dutch silver and by the 1930s it was the most important silver factory in Schoonhoven. A couple of web sites including waxantiques.com noted that “A not inconsiderable part of the company owed its existence to the savings campaigns of the famous Dutch coffee roaster & coffee & tea blender named Douwe Egberts. Among consumers Hooykaas was well known as the supplier of the Douwe Egberts-spoons. Every pack of coffee & tea made by Douwe Egberts, I believe since the late sixties, comes with a point’s coupon. A certain amount of points could be exchanged for coffee cups, silver plated coffee canisters and the famous silver plated spoons with the fancy monogram D.E on it for Douwe Egberts.”  By the late 1960s the demand for fine silver waned, and in 1993 after economic difficulties the company merged into the United Gold and Silver factories Schoonhoven, together with the silver factories Zilverstad and Niekerk.  It finally closed near the end of the millenium, and in 2005 the factory was demolished to make way for  an urban development of 5 types of housing termed “Nieuw Hooijkaas” that seems to be very popular since a check on the web indicated that all the properties had been sold.</p>

                  a whole lot of city or makers marks that I haven’t been able to identify, but is (problematically)
                  Dutch because there’s a (blurry) Minerva head on the lid. It’s import marked for London in 1891 by
                  Samuel Boyce Landeck of Campden Place.  I need some expert advice on this one, both regarding the
                  multitude of unidentified marks, and because Landeck is said by one web site to not have registered
                  until February 1902 (this may well have been in a different city).  On the other hand, the very reliable Online Encyclopedia of Silver Marks,
                  Hallmarks and Makers Marks notes that Landek was a known imported of Hanau silver, and dates him in
                  London from 1879.  The multitude of marks (pseudo-marks most likely) would imply to me that this cow
                  is from Hanau rather than Holland but again I haven’t been able to identify them.</p>

			<bloqkquote>
			<p> These two German early 20c cow creamers look quite similar but took quite different paths to my collection as quite clearly evidenced bythe marks. The one on the left (and with the marks in the left shot below) was fashioned by Kark Kurz of Kesselstadt, which at that time was a separate municipality but since 1907 became a district of Hanau. This explains the Hanau pseudo-marks. Kurz's studio was founded in 1877, and merged with Gebruder Dingledein (who married Kurz's daugfhter) around 1911.  The British marks are for importer Theodor Hartmann of St Martin's House, 1 Gresham St. later 14 Paternoster Row, who was Kurz's English agent. In addition to the other London marks it shows a date or 1902.  The cow on the right, with the clearly delineated ribs, is German 925 silver marked Sterling and in script Cartier and, I believe, retailed in the US. In addition to the German Halbmund & Krone there are two marks on it I can't identify,  one that looks like a keyhole eith a dot, and the other on the far left that seems to be a company name of some sort.\], perhaps "..son LTD" but that's just a guess</p></blockquote>

                <p>This one also retains some Schuppe influence, and is included because it is a good example of an
                  engraved creamer…in this case, as a present for “Franklin Frazee Moore II, Born July 27, 1963,
                  Christened 11-10-1963”. The seller indicated that he acquired it from the Edgehill Estate of Deal,
                  NJ;
                  it’s marked “Sterling”, thus is either American or made for the US market. I haven’t been able to
                  locate
                  any information on Mr Moore II, but his father and grandfather were both Presidents of Rider College
                  in
                  Lawrenceville, NJ, their consecutive terms lastingfrom 1898-1969. No wonder this apparent family
                  sinecure didn’t last to a third generation, since FFM II was only 6 when his father gave up the

                <p> Here is a sterling silver cow creamer imported to London in 1897 by Elly Issac Miller, registered
                  in 1892 as a plate maker and foreign agent. It is clearly marked F for foreign on both the lid and
                  belly, but there is no indication of where or by whom it was made. I'd be willing to bet that it came
                  from Hanau, but that's only a guess. It has taken a couple dings - the right eye is pushed in rather
                  than protruding, and the tail is somewhat bent. I sense from those minor faults and the condition of
                  the body that looks like it has seen a lot of polishing, that this one has actually experienced
                  considerable use. It came from a family estate from a wealthy area in Southampton, NY, and folks that
                  live there might well have considered this a normal piece of dinner (or breakfast?) ware. At least it
                  makes me happy to think that this lovely piece served as more than a tarnish catcher. It came to me
                  at what I consider a bargain price, since the seller started it reasonably and it turned out I was
                  the only one who showed it a bit of love.</p>

                <p>No, this one isn’t a Schuppe copy, but I decided to put it here (as well as on the miniatures page)
                  because it was attributed by the seller to Acquisto, and it came to her with a lot of other old
                  silver items from a ‘gorgeous Tynietoy mansion”.  There are two stories to tell here – the maker and
                  Tynietoy; as I found out some time later the seller was wrong about the first, but I have no reason
                  to doubt the quality of the collection from which it came.</p>
                <p>This lovely tiny cow (looks like a bull to me but you be the judge) that's here tromping on George was fashioned by Eugene
                  Kupjack, and is his Miniature Dollhouse Silver #353. From his obituary in the NY Times I learned that
                  Kupjack, who died in 1991 at the age of 79, over his lifetime fashioned more than  700 period-style
                  miniature rooms with 1/12 scale doll house furnishings. He is perhaps best known for the 30
                  shadow-box settings that were designed (and funded) by Narcissa Niblack Thorne, widow of a Montgomery
                  Ward & Co heir. These were first displayed at the 1939 Worlds Fair, then donated to the Art
                  Institute of Chicago.  </p>
                <p>For those of you who aren’t dollhouse miniature aficionados, there’s a lot of info on the web about
                  Tynietoy. One good source is the Francis Clay Antiques site, where I learned “Tynietoy was a company
                  started by two talented women, Marion Perkins and Amy Vernon in about 1917 in Providence, Rhode
                  Island. They made miniature replicas of popular furniture designs in the styles representing Early
                  American through to the Victorian era. ...Over the years, or decades rather, leading to approximately
                  WWII the women grew the company to include other employees, craftsmen, and a huge line of miniature
                  furnishings. ...The miniature furniture was initially made independent of display spaces, but
                  eventually Tynietoy began making miniature replicas of New England style houses to sell along with
                  the furnishings.”  These days original Tynietoy houses and furniture make my cows seem inexpensive!</p>

                  this clipped add for James Robinson’s NY Old English Silver shop, from a 1926 edition of “The
                  Connoisseur”. It’s interesting that Miller’s creamer bear a family resemblance to Schuppe’s…and
                  also, that the Schuppe cow shown here has a heavier chest than do mine. I can find absolutelky nothing about Robert Miller, but Robinson’s is still
                  in business so I naturally asked them for more information, but they replied that it was too many
                  years ago for them to have any knowledge. What a shame. </p>

Then there are a number of silver cow creamers from England, Holland, Germany, Italy, and Spain.  Those are followed by a few bulls - even though they aren't noted for their milk-giving ability, they is I guess some rationale for fashioning bull creamers since they are indeed responsible for turning heifers into milk-makers.  Then there are a whole bunch of small or single-serving cow creamers. I assume that these were made so that you could put one at each place when serving a number of guests. And finally, as with other parts of my collection, there are a few that don't quite fit the basic definition but were of interest. </p></blockquote></td>

                <p><br>
                  I started corresponding with Veronica Shaw after I bought one of her Schuppe copies on eBay. After a
                  number of emails, I asked her to design and make a silver cow creamer for me.  The result was
                  “Bluebell”, a heavy Modigliani-inspired “Auroch”-like lost-wax cast creamer, standing on a heavily
                  enameled base plate (which also, please note, bears the fly).  The patterning under the enamel is
                  designed to make it look like watered silk, and the cow is heavily chased.  The base bears her “VJS”
                  (Veronica Jane Shaw) makers mark, the lion rampant, 925 (it’s actually 958, Brittania Silver), the
                  Leopard Head assay, and the Queens Head special mark for 2002. The cow itself was assayed in 2003,
                  and bears simply the maker’s and assay marks.</p>
                <p>When I met Veronica during a quick trip to London a year or so later, she showed me a creamer she
                  had made for another patron (it’s on her web site).  I liked it so much I asked her to make a similar
                  one for me, and the result is the Dali-inspired Dalina, bearing a Schuppe head and modernistic body,
                  again on a beautifully enameled silver stand.  Dalina was assayed in London in 2004, and enjoys
                  looking at her dangling fly.  Later, my wife and I had the pleasure of hosting Veronica during her
                  trip to the US. </p>

                <p>This large bull is a silver version of a Peruvian ‘Torito de Pucara’. He was crafted for me by
                  virtually every artisan in the shop of this silversmithing company while my wife and I spent 3 days
                  visiting Machu Pichu and the area around Cusco.  It also appears in the Peru section of the Places
                  page along with more of an explanation of the Toritos.  This shop had all different kinds of lovely
                  silver jewelry and figures, but they had never before made a Torito de Pucara.  They probably thought
                  I was a bit strange for asking them to make one, but nevertheless willingly complied  (at US
                  $5/gram), went out and purchased a couple ceramic ones for a model, and this is the result.</p>

The one on the left bears only a "sterling" mark, and the one on the right bears both that and the name of "Shreve & Co.", as well as a "U-" brand on its left rump. Shreve & Co's web site notes that they "have called San Francisco home since 1852", starting as Shreve Jewelry Company. Then in 1894 they were incoporated as Shreve & Company by George Rodman and Albert J. Lewis. Initially located on Market street, they moved to the corner of Post and Grant in 1906 a month before the earthquake, and their building was one of the few that remained stabnding afterwards. In 1992 they went bankrupt and were acquired by a couple new owners; then in 2015 they lost their lease due to skyrocketing costs around Union Square, and opened a new flagship store a bit further away at 150 Post street. They also have a location in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. These creamers are quite heavy, presumably cast.</p></blockquote>

                  On the left is a Dutch creamer from @1880.  The seller, on Portobello Road, said that the previous
                  owner was a UK doctor who thought it was French, and had taken it to Australia (and back to London)
                  with him.  A well-traveled cow.  The smaller creamer in the middle bears the marks “Sterling,
                  Germany, 925”, and what looks like a “1”.  On the right is a fully chased cow with a round mouth and
                  a buckled belt for a collar, Dutch from @1890.  The lids on these are interesting – the two on the
                  left have a pommel or knob on the front to help with opening, and the one on the right has a tiny fly
                  which serves the same purpose.</p>

                    are sufficiently clear that it’s a good example of Dutch hallmarking.  The lion passant with the
                    ‘2’ (which became a Roman II after 1953) is the symbol for .833 purity. The Medusa head with an
                    impressed letter indicates the assay office –  A for Amsterdam in this case – and the letter in the
                    circle is the date, in this case a slant M for 1947.  The sword mark on the tail – this style sword
                     was used from 1906-1953 – is a standard or purity mark used on pieces added to the base figure, or
                    too small for the lion.  There also is one on the inside of this creamer’s lid.  All this

                <p>These two, which while acquired separately seem to be to be a pair, are also nearly identical to the
                  one above.  They are however, from my reading of the marks, much older.  The smaller of them bears
                  the lion passant an older Minerva head, and the “I” in a circle which the best I can tell is for
                  1843.  The maker’s mark is partially obscured, but I’s guess it to be “HB”.  The larger cow has only
                  the “835” and an illegible maker’s mark.  It’s continental for sure, but whether Dutch, German of
                  whatever I really don’t know.  It is so similar to the one above and the smaller here however that
                  I’d guess Dutch, and again likely 19c.</p>

                <p> A knowledgeable seller kindly informed me that although I thought this was Dutch, it
                  is most likely from "Hanau, Germany, by B.Neresheimer &amp; Sohne...Hanau makers used elaborate marks
                  (pseudo marks) to stamp their silver. &quot; </p>
                <p>This is a good place to insert a few words about Hanau and Hanau Silver – derived largely from an
                  extensive write-up on the excellent web site of the Association of Small Collectors of Antique
                  Silver, ASCAS, at <a href="http://www.ascasonline.org/articolo13.html">http://www.ascasonline.org/articolo13.html</a>. 
                  Hanau is in Hesse, Germany, about 25 km east of Frankfurt am Main.  It addition to being the home
                  town of the Brothers Grimm and Franciscus Sylvius, from near the end of the 16c it became a center of
                  precious metal working when the local Count attracted Protestant Walloon refugees from France and the
                  Netherlands who brought their knowledge of jewelry and similar luxury goods with them. According to
                  the ASCAS article, however, the Hanau work in ‘antique silver’ for which it is noted today –
                  masterful copies as well as original pieces, at least for the next several decades – didn’t really
                  begin until the 1860s when the silversmith August Schleissner relocated there after spells in Paris,
                  Germany and the US, then returned to Hanau and with his brother took over the Schleissner company and
                  started a line of antique reproduction silver that because extremely popular with royalty and the
                  rich.  The other leading firm for this type of silverware was Neresheimer, founded in 1890 (and the
                  maker of this and several of my other Hanau creamers).  Like Schleissner, Neresheimer’s workshop
                  produced extremely high quality goods, both reproductions and original pieces.  Much of his work
                  bears the import names or marks for his London agent Berthold Mueller, or Bucholz &amp; Zelt
                  (B&amp;Z) and Tiffany &amp; Co. in the US.  The success of such high quality firms led to a rapid
                  growth in the number of antique silver producers in Hanau starting in the very late 19c, and the
                  resulting frenzied  competition led to a decrease in the quality of workmanship and the introduction
                  of mass produced items , which – together with the Hanau  practice of  using ‘fantasy’ or spurious
                  marks often made to look like the guild marks from pieces that they copied – earned the later Hanau
                  silver a quite dubious reputation.  This cow and the next one down are from Neresheimer and, at least
                  to my eye, are representative of the early very high quality work of that firm.  </p>

                  reproductions.  It’s readily identifiable as theirs by the script ‘n’,  and the chevron pseudomark;
                  chevrons were part of the Hanau crest as well as the older Hanau city mark.  I don’t have any idea
                  about the third mark – the one that looks like a sideways capital “D” – it could be a date mark, but
                  then there were a variety of those in different countries, and I’ve not heard that Neresheimer had
                  its own set.</p>

			<p> This cow is very realistic and beautifully crafted. The seller thought it might be Dutch, but to me the marks look much more like Hanau pseudo-marks. No moon and crown, which if German places it before 1886. It's quite heavy thus I believe likely 925 silver. One interesting feature is that there is only a small bump in place of an udder (and no other 'equipment'). I couldn't find exact examples of the marks, especially the complex one on the right, but Neuresheimer has used both the capital N and the animal with extended paw; and it's sufficiently well done that it may well have come from that workshop. As always I would greatly appreciate comments and corrections.</p></td>

                  had acquired them on a trip to Germany, presumably in the early 1900s (before WWI).  The pseudo-marks
                  again identify them as from Hanau, although in this case I haven’t been able to identify the maker. 
                  For those with further interest, I can suggest three sources. The first is the Online Encyclopedia of
                  Silver marks, hallmarks, and makers marks,  <a href="http://www.925-1000.com/">www.925-1000.com</a>, 
                  which has a special page devoted to Hauau pseudo marks. The second is articles by Dorothes Bustyn on
                  “The Antique Silver Industry of Hanau”, which can be found on the web site of the Association of
                  Small Collectors of Antique Silver, <a href="http://www.ascasonline.org/">www.ascasonline.org</a>.
                  The third is the section on Hanau hallmarks on the related site, <a href="http://www.silvercollection.it/">www.silvercollection.it</a>. 
                  Quoting briefly from there, “Mark stamping as practiced in Hanau would have been completely illegal
                  in France or England, or for that matter in any other German city where a guild supervised the
                  marking. But Hanau had a long tradition as a free-trade city. With the production of &quot;antique
                  silver&quot;, Hanau found a market niche, which brought its silver manufacturers enormous prosperity
                  and worldwide reputation. The 'father' of this industry was August Schleissner. The other leading
                  firm of Hanau was Neresheimer, founded in 1890 as a partnership of August and Ludwig Neresheimer with
                  Jean Schlingloff.”</p>

                  written confirmation to back this story up, he believes it to be true because he acquired it “through
                  a friend who recently cleared the house of the Queen's housekeeper…her relative said that she (the
                  housekeeper) was allowed to select a few items to keep when the Queen died in Lausanne, Switzerland
                  in 1969, and that this was one of those items.”  He didn’t advertise the cow this way, but passed
                  this on when I inquired about its provenance – so I believe it too, because I had already bought it
                  and he had no reason to feed me –so to speak – a line of bull. Gee, perhaps I now have a royal cow!
                   It addition to the story, I particularly like this creamer because of its very unusual  shape, and
                  the fact that its lid (with the tip of its tail) lifts off rather than being hinged.  True story or
                  not, the cow is indeed unique and quite lovely..</p>

			<p> This cow creamer is for sure Spanish, with a mark for "Madrid", although neither I nor the seller can identify the maker's mark. I was told that it  came from a family of bankers in Zaragoza.  It's nice and heavy, fairly modern - must be a steer since there's no "equipment' of any sort between the hind legs. Of most interest, there is a large engraved cross over a conjoined BR on the left rump.  The seller checked and indicated that it didn't match any known brands, nor did the bankers have any relationship to cattle, so presumably it is related to a family name  The engraving is nicely and simply done and adds to the cow's beauty as well as the mystery. It is certainly a well made cow creamer and different from all my others.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			</p>Here are two more Italian silver cow creamers, and with a bunch of searching I think I was able to track down a bit of information about them. For some of this you might wish to refer to the pictures just below.
			The cows are quite similar - both were fashioned by "Coppini & C." now known as Fratelli Coppini. The one with the jeweled filagree butterfly on the lid is slightly larger than the one with the plain lid.  They both bear "800" marks and a maker's or factory mark, both under the lid and on hind hooves. The mker's mark is a lozenge shape, and although they are hard to read I believe they bear a "7", a fascio or fascist mark, and the letters Fi for Flrenze or Florence. From Giorgio Busetto's marvelous website, "silvercollection.it", "A Small Collection of Antique Silver and Objects of Vertu" we learn that this mark conforms to law n. 305 of 5 February 1934 which introduced uniformity into silversmith's marks.  The numnber designated the factory or maker, and the letters indicate the city. In 1944 the fascist mark was eliminated, and laws of 1968 and 1970 introduced new and diferently shaped marks, although the number and city designation were retained.  The number '7' was registered by Giulio Coppini in 1935.  A couple different Coppini registrations also show up at different addresses, but these cows apparently came from the Giulio Coppini site and must date from between 1935 and 1944.  Fratelli ('Brothers') Coppini is still in business, and their web site dates the roots  of the company to 1740, beginning as a silversmith's shop. They later moved into watchmaking and jewelry, and note that "Ongoing research and careful selection of precious stones, creativity and insight are the key to the success of Fratelli Coppini, which now ranks as an equal among the greatest names of Italian high jewelry". Presumably the butterfly on the larger of my cows attests to the shift to fancy one of a kind pieces.  What follows are images of the butterfly and the lid and hoof marks from the larger cow, then the lid mark from the smaller one.</p></blockquote>

                <p>This very heavy and extremely ornate creamer with the very large and detailed fly was made by
                  Garrard &amp; Co. of London in 1997; it bears their “G&amp;Co.Ltd” hallmark and the lion rampant and
                  leopard-head London assay, as well as the Garrard stamp.  This company was founded by silversmith
                  George Wickes (1698-1761) in London in 1735 and underwent several name and partnership changes before
                  becoming Garrard &amp; Co @1802.  Queen Victoria bestowed the honor of Crown Jeweler on Garrard in
                  1843, a responsibility they retained until 2007.  They amalgamated with the Goldsmiths and
                  Silversmiths Co. Ltd in 1952, which was taken over in turn by Mappin &amp; Webb (established in 1797)
                  in 1959. <a href="http://www.antiquesilverspoons.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.antiquesilverspoons.co.uk</a>
                  notes that in the early 60’s Mappin &amp; Webb combined with Walker and Hall and Elkington  &amp; Co.
                  and are still active today as retailers under the auspices of British Silverware Ltd.” 
                  Interestingly, Wikipedia has a somewhat different version of their recent history, noting that
                  Garrard demerged in 2002, then was acquired by the US private equity firm Yucaipa Cos. in 2006 (which
                  may explain why they are no longer the crown jewelers…).  Can someone correct or verify all this?? 
                  Oh, the tangled webs of recent M&amp;As!.  Whatever, it’s a lovely cow creamer, albeit a bitch to
                  polish with all those protrusions!</p>

                <p>These are extremely large, heavy, and exquisitely crafted German 925 creamers.  I believe they are
                  late 19c, but they certainly date from after 1868 when the Germans standardized the national hallmark
                  to be a crescent moon and crown (Halbmond und Krone).  They bear these and the 925 mark on the tail,
                  as well as a standing lion.  One of them is also stamped for “Germany”, presumably meaning it was
                  made for export (I got the one without that stamp directly from Germany – so some of these apparently
                  stayed home).  I’ve searched diligently through the main (and excellent) web sources on German

                  “B&amp;Z, 800, GERMANY”, and an unidentifiable maker’s mark. B&amp;Z stands for Bucholz &amp; Zelt,
                  US importers located at 22 W 48th St, New York (an Otto Bucholz &amp; Co  of 1170 Broadway traded as
                  early as 1904, and was still around – advertising in the Jeweler’s Circular – in 1920; I haven’t yet
                  found out when the name changed, or rather when Mr Zelt became a partner and the B&amp;Z firm was
                  established, and whether it was Otto or some other Bucholz that joined with him.  B&amp;Z imported a
                  lot of Hanau silver, much from J.D. Schleissner &amp; Sohne, but the maker’s mark on these, as well
                  as the other one I have from B&amp;Z, is badly blurred [&amp; Schleissner used a whole flock of
                  different ones].  The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 required the name of the country of origin to be
                  stamped on imports…and in 1914 this was amended to include the words “Made In”.  My best guess
                  therefore is that these are Hanau silver, certainly imported prior to WWI</p>

                <p>&nbsp;Then there’s this elegant pair, she and he.&nbsp; The bull has an open back, but does indeed
                  have a mouth hole so he qualifies as a creamer even if he’s intended to carry sugar.&nbsp; His lady
                  friend has a lid with a simple aft-facing fly and indented floral decorations. Both of these lovely
                  creamers bear “STERLING, handmade”as well as an Old English “m”, which is the mark of William B.
                  Meyers (1887-1958).  I learned a bit about him from a November 2011 article in Antiques and Auction
                  News which discussed the forthcoming sale of his personal collection of his work, including dollhouse
                  miniatures. That article notes that he “was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the first of five
                  children born to a German father and Polish mother, and moved to New York City with his family when
                  he was ten. He exhibited artistic ability as a child, and with the encouragement of his art teacher,
                  he initially considered a career as a designer for a wallpaper company until it was discovered he was
                  color-blind. He also had ambition to be an actor and after graduating in 1907 from City College of
                  New York, he toured the deep South with a dramatic company and developed a vaudeville act. He
                  returned to New York after impassioned entreaties from his family, and upon his return, he began a
                  four-year apprenticeship with a German silversmith in lower Manhattan.” He became interested in sales
                  as well as design while working for the Wilcox-Roth Company in Newark, New Jersey. In 1913 he bought
                  the company and changed its name the William B. Meyers Company. It remained in business for over 50
                  years. He started making miniatures for his own pleasure in the late 1920s, and continued doing so
                  till his wife died in 1947 at which time he focused on religious sterling hollowware.  I have no idea
                  of the date of this pair of his creamers other than they must be from before 1947, but they are
                  extremely well done. </p>

                  one would set out at each place at a fancy dinner party.  Here’s an overview of my herd of them…all
                  about 3” tall or less, and in these herd shots accompanied by the little doll house Schuppe model
                  from Peter Acquisto that was described above and in the Miniatures page.  Following are some pictures
                  and descriptions of the ones not already depicted, and their marks.</p>

			<p> Lets start the 'small' silver cow creamer area with a quite new one, dated "c" for 2002. It's very nicely done, and has an open back and a huge udder. Its marks interestingly are on the bottom of the right front hoof. These include the three linked ovals and the letters LL for Links of London, as well as the modern 925 sterling mark, the now-optional sterling mark and the London assay mark (not easy to read - but then these marks are all extremely tiny). Interestingly and perhaps unfortunately (at least for some 375+employees), Links of London went into "administration" on 9 October 2019, the day after their little cow joined my collection.</p></blockquote>

                <p>This stately small steer was sold as French, but I’m not sure.  The markings are very unusual in
                  that they’re spread out… what is most likely the maker’s mark – JR ? – on the tail; what looks to me
                  to be a lion with one paw out in front (back parts blurred) on the belly; and  a sort of fuzzy blob
                  that the seller thought might be a Minerva’s head under the lid.  No fly – so for sure it’s not
                  English, and it must live in a very clean pasture.  I could certainly use some help with this one.</p>

                  through eBay in 2000.  Its markings are a lot of fun…In one direction there’s a “KS” surrounded by
                  three dots for Karl Schatz of <span id="lw_1233883001_2">Hanau</span> who was active in the 1st
                  quarter of the 20th century (info courtesy of the Online Encyclopedia of Silver Marks…), and 930
                  silver.  The German crown and crescent mark are absent although they were supposed to be compulsory
                  after 1888, presumably because it was made expressly for a British importer.  The marks in the other
                  direction show that it was imported into the UK (the ‘u’ in the circle is the British import mark
                  used since 1906) in 1912 (that’s the “r”)  by “R.L” (which is right in the middle of the camera
                  reflection), whom I can’t identify, and it is considered sterling by the Brits (925).  Someone has
                  also scratched “O8W” – or more likely “M&amp;O” into the bottom.  No idea what that is…</p>

                <p>This very tiny but delightful little guy is a bit of a cheat for the collection since instead of
                  having two holes, his head is on a hinge. He’s so cute however that I couldn’t resist.  I’d guess he
                  was probably a snuff box.  His marks are interesting since they’re both outside on the neck and on
                  the inside rim.  Outside, the F is the British import mark used from 1867-1904.  The lion passant
                  stands for sterling, and the T=1894.  These are repeated and the English Leopard head added inside,
                  and on the other side is the mark of the importer, DB for David Bridge, General Manager of John
                  George Smith &amp; Co., Manufacturers, who imported a lot of silver items, many from Germany although
                  there is no definite indication of origin here. </p>

                <p>My wife bought this lovely hammered silver pitcher for me during a visit to Dublin in 1997.  The
                  marks show a London assay, 1979.  The maker’s mark is HM which, thanks to a reader of my site, I have
                  learned is for  Hector Miller (born 1945), an eminent London silversmith who trained at Stuart
                  Devlin's workshop..  I learned from a similar pitcher that recently came up for sale on eBay that
                  these were made for the Centenary of the Jersey Cow Society of the UK, which was founded in 1878. 
                  Their web page notes that “Jersey cattle originate from Jersey, the largest Island in the Channel
                  Islands and just some 14 miles away from the French coast. There are fewer than 6000 Jerseys on the
                  Island in total with nearly 4000 of these being adult milking cows. The purity of the breed on the
                  Island is maintained by a strict ban on imports. This ban has been in place for some 150 years. There
                  are no other breeds of the cattle on the Island. The Jersey shares a common ancestry with not only
                  the Guernsey breed but also those cattle found on the Normandy and Brittany coasts. This type of
                  cattle is believed to have originally traveled up across Europe from the Middle East. Jerseys are
                  known to exist in the UK mainland since 1741 and probably well before. At that time they were known
                  as Alderney's .”  The folks that live on the island are rightly proud of their breed and Jersey cow
                  creamers, appropriately labeled but of many styles, are (or at least were) popular souvenirs. You’ll
                  find a small herd of them on the Advertising and Souvenirs page.</p>

                I almost hate to put this lovely creamer on a stand so far down the page, but it is significantly
                different than the others because it’s silver plated rather than solid silver. It’s well marked for the
                maker, George Richmond Collis, who in 1835 took over the firm of Sir Edward Thomason at 28 Church
                Street, Birmingham, moving in 1868 to Cambridge Street. In 1854 Collis opened a branch at 130 Regent
                Street, London. The firm was absorbed by S.W. Smith &amp;amp; Co in 1888. This creamer is clearly marked
                for the London address, and I need to do more homework to interpret the rest of the marks and gain more
                information. I’ve shown it next to an electroplated nickel silver one by PT&amp;;Co (no further info)
                since it bears a family resemblance although with clear differences.

                <p>Here is a second George Richmond Collis silver-plated cow, differing from the one above only by
                  slightly different horns and fly.  One thing that makes it interesting is that on the right flank it
                  bears an engraved crown over “GR”.  Of course I’d like to believe that that stands for George Rex, or
                  King George, but then again there are no numbers so even if so it’d be hard to say which one.</p>

                has thin Schuppe-like legs, and the teats appear to be simply little pieces of wire. It has no markings
                and thus I have no real information on when and where it was made. However it came to me from Buenos
                Aires, Argentina (shortly after my wife and I had visited there) and the seller could only say that he
                acquired it from the estate of a wealthy collector and that he estimated it to date from the 1920’s or
                30’s.</td>
