                  From C. Bernhard Hughes’ fine historical accounts in his 1957 book <em>Small Antique Silverware</em>,
                  we learn that “A quaint conceit of the third quarter of the eighteenth century was the milk jug
                  modeled in the form of a cow.  Although the name of John Schuppe” (a Dutch silversmith who moved to
                  London ~1750 and registered his mark there in 1753) “is particularly associated with these jugs there
                  is evidence of hall-marks that David Willaume the younger” (a Hugenot silversmith, 1693-1761) “was
                  making them before Schuppe, who remains an obscure figure, dying in 1773.  Silver cows, as they were
                  listed at the assay office, were made in sections. The sides of the head and body were made
                  separately as were legs and hooves, horns, ears, and the tail handle which looped upward over the
                  haunches. The top of the hollow body was fitted with a curved hinged lid, like a saddle, either plain
                  or bordered with chased flowers and foliage, and with a lifting knob in the form of a large fly
                  modeled in the round. The jug was filled through the lidded opening, the milk being poured into the
                  tea-cup from the animal’s mouth.  Head and body might be tooled to represent the cow’s hair, but
                  others were left smooth-surfaced except for some tool work representing hair between horns and eyes,
                  and along the back bone, this being applied with the intention of concealing joints…Silver cows
                  approximate 4 inches in height; an example by Schuppe sold at Christie’s weighed 4 oz, 15 dwt. In
                  modeling, as in general design, the style is naïve but lively.  Many were gilded and a crest might be
                  engraved on the side of the body.  In some instances the neck was engraved with an inscribed collar.”</p>
                <p>I would like to thank Peter Cameron, a London silversmith (of Vault 57 in the London Silver Vaults)
                  for some additional information about John Schuppe, whom it seems is really quite hard to pin down. 
                  He notes that there were some Schuppes of German origin in London at that time, so the assumption
                  that silversmith Schuppe of the cows was Dutch may indeed be mistaken.   Our elusive silversmith
                  apparently worked in the liberty (an area in which rights reserved to the king had been devolved into
                  private hands) of St Martin’s le Grand (at first in Little Dean's Court and then in New Rents), which
                  is located in the City of London between Newgate Street and Cheapside to the south, and Aldersgate
                  Street to the north.  Mr Cameron stated in an email to me dated May 2012 that “I am pretty clear that
                  John Schuppe, the silversmith, had a wife named Mary and that they had a son, John, who was born in
                  1760 and died in 1823. He was listed as a watchmaker, hardware and toyman in an insurance policy with
                  the Sun Insurance Company in 1804. This last John Schuppe had no children. There were daughters of
                  John, the silversmith, and Mary his wife, as follows: Elizabeth, who married a John Phillips in 1782
                  and had a son named John Schuppe Phillips; Ann christened 1754 of whom no more as yet; and Mary who
                  married Mathew Hodson in 1781 and had various children. John Schuppe, silversmith, was certainly
                  alive quite late in the year 1773 but his wife, Mary, (then living in London Wall), wrote her will in
                  1795 when she described herself as a widow. The only hope of finding more detail is combing through
                  the rate books for the period - if I can find the Schuppes listed in them and if they survive.”  He
                  was also kind enough to pass on the following fascinating clipping from the “Gazetteer and London
                  Daily Advertiser” (London), Monday, February 23, 1756; Issue 4504: </p>

                <p> Most of Schuppe’s creamers date from around the 1760’s; he died in 1773.  I have two Schuppe’s in
                  my collection (both acquired from I. Franks Antique Silver in the London Silver Vaults), shown in
                  both side and front views, along with their hallmarks: Schuppe’s JS, the lion rampant denoting
                  silver, the leopard head with crown which is the early London assay mark, and the date stamp, here
                  1764 for the smooth creamer (Hairiette) and 1768 for the chased one (Hairy).  </p>

                <p>The fly on the lid – flies being pervasive around cows and milking (and not as disparaged then as
                  now, I’ve heard) – has become traditional on silver creamers, as you will see on much of the rest of
                  the collection; and the scrawny legs have also carried on through the years; butts, however, are a
                  different story, and  differ widely. Schuppe’s seem somewhat more realistic than many others. </p>
                <p>I’d like to learn more about John Schuppe and about David Willaume II and his creamer as well, if
                  someone can kindly point me to a source.  <A href="http://www.ukauctioneers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.UKauctioneers.com</A>
                  has a very nice glossary (that they attribute to Reader’s Digest’s “Treasures in your Home”) that
                  notes that “David Willaume I (1658-1741) [was a] huguenot silversmith who worked in London using many
                  techniques and designs which were far advanced. His pieces are individualistic … His son David
                  Willaume II (1693 -1761) took over the business in 1716. For a time the two silversmiths were thought
                  to be one and the same”.  There is nothing about Schuppe, however.</p>

                <p><br> Schuppe’s traditional form remains popular, as these modern versions attest.
                  The two facing each other in the leftmost picture, one smooth and the other chased, both
                  date from 2002 and thus bear the QEII Jubilee special mark as well as the lion rampant
                  and the London assay leopard head, plus the maker’s mark “TB” for Timothy Joseph
                  Burtwell of Tring, Hertfordshire who apprenticed with William Comyns. He made the mold,
                  did the pressing and assembling and had them polished, chased and assayed. I purchased
                  them from Veronica Shaw who named them Daisy and Doris (and from who I later
                  commissioned Bluebell and Dalina, see below). The third creamer, also chased, is also
                  from 2002 and bears the “A&amp;T” hallmark of Adams and Taber. These are all fine modern
                  copies, and bear a close resemblance to the originals (except for the price tag), as you
                  can see from the group photo.</p>

                <p>Yet another Schuppe copy, not that I really needed one … but I was curious about its possible maker
                  and age and it was reasonably priced. The only marks are under the lid – “xxx” in an oval, and two
                  unidentifiable symbols. There are quite a number of Dutch silversmiths who used xxx as their mark,
                  generally with some other symbol added, so I assume it’s from Holland. The only one I could find that
                  used just the letters in the shape this one has is Diederik Willem Rethmeyer who worked in Amsterdam
                  in the early 1800s.  This cow is shiny and looks new – and was relatively inexpensive as these things
                  go, so I doubt it’s by him – presumably some enterprising chap is turning them out in large numbers
                  given their continuing popularity.  </p>

                  popular with silversmiths from both the UK and the continent, up to the present day. It does have a
                  rather unique shape to the tail.  While without marks it’s impossible to give it an age or
                  provenance, I’d guess it to be quite modern, and likely English because of its weight.</p>

                  the two just above.  It’s interesting in that it has a gold wash.  Tiffany’s produced a number of
                  creamers of this shape – I’ve even seen one with diamonds in the eyes and anus (of all things), but
                  it was a bit too rich for my taste. Interestingly, both the belly and the lid of this cow bear the
                  lion passant and the Elizabeth II lion head for the London assay, but there is no maker’s mark. 
                  Tiffany contracted with quite a few silversmiths for their products, and apparently didn’t feel it
                  important to identify them.</p>

                <p>This little cow, inspired by Schuppe’s, is marked R.C for Richard Comyns. It bears a <u></u><u></u>London<u></u><u></u>
                  sterling assay mark and is dated 1968.  A search for information about it not only told me quite a
                  bit about the some of the transitions in British silversmithing, but revealed that this model (the
                  only one to the best of my knowledge) is currently still in routine production. Here is what I have
                  learned (more than you may wish to know…): first, from Koopermanrareart.com (and others), the Comyns
                  firm “was established by William Comyns c. 1859 when he purchased the business of Robert Tagg, itself
                  said to have been founded about 1730. As yet efforts to trace the latter's lineage have failed; it
                  seems clear, however, that Tagg succeeded John Tapley at 40 Roupell Street, Waterloo Road. Tapley, a
                  manufacturing silversmith, was probably the last of Rundell, Bridge &amp; Co.'s outworkers and is
                  also known to have provided work for Robert Green &amp; Co and Makepeace &amp; Walford. Robert Tagg
                  moved in 1857 to his new residence and manufactory at <u></u><u></u>2 Carlise Street<u></u><u></u>,
                  <u></u><u></u>Soho Square<u></u><u></u>, where by 1859 he listed as a silversmith. William Comyns,
                  thereafter listed as a silversmith, appears to have purchased the business in 1858 or early 1859,
                  entering his first marks from the first same address. He moved to 1 Percy Mews, <u></u><u></u>Rathbone
                  Place<u></u><u></u>, then to <u></u><u></u>16 Silver Street<u></u><u></u>, <u></u><u></u>Golden
                  Square<u></u><u></u>, <u></u>Soho<u></u>, and subsequently to <u></u><u></u>Beak Street<u></u><u></u>,
                  <u></u><u></u>Regent Street<u></u><u></u>. These premises were later expanded to 41, 43, and <u></u><u></u>45
                  Beak Street<u></u><u></u> and to 41, 43, 45, <u></u><u></u>47 Beak Street<u></u><u></u>. Additional
                  premises were taken from c. 1903 at <u></u><u></u>54 Marshall Street<u></u><u></u>, <u></u>Soho<u></u>.
                  The style of the firm was changed to William Comyns &amp; Son c. 1885 when William Comyn's two sons,
                  Charles Harling Comyns and Richard Harling Comyns were admitted to their partnership. William Comyns
                  died in January 1916, and C.H. Comyns while attending a sale in Christie's in 1925. The business was
                  incorporated as limited liability company as William Comyns &amp; Sons Ltd., registered on <u></u>20th
                  October 1930<u></u>, with R.H. Comyns as permanent governing director. Upon the latter's death in
                  1953, when the firm is said to have lost its former prominence, William Comyns &amp; Sons Ltd was
                  purchased by Bernard Copping.”  From 1957 the firm was located on Tower St London WC2.  Comyns’
                  original mark apparently was W.C, followed by C&amp;R after William’s death, and then R.C from @1922
                  to 1984, when Mr. Coping died.  I haven’t yet located any information about the fate of the firm
                  immediately after that point, but a <u></u>November 22, 2008<u></u> article in The Star stated that
                  Comyns was acquired in 1993 by the Malaysia-owned Royal Selangor Group, and around 1998 they moved
                  production to their plant in Wangsa Maju.  The company’s web site – <a href="http://comyns-silver.com"
                    target="_blank">http://comyns-silver.com</a> – notes that their archives contain some 35,000
                  historical molds, patterns, tools, and drawings, and that they produce both traditional English and
                  European heritage items as well as contemporary ones, with marketing targeted toward Japan, Australia
                  and Singapore as well as Europe, US and UK.  A response to my query to their Malaysian headquarters
                  about the cow creamer – which can be found via a search on their web site and is undoubtedly
                  fashioned from one of their historical molds – states that they trade as Comyns (<u></u><u></u>Malaysia<u></u><u></u>)
                  Sdn Bhd and Comyns of London. The cow creamers being produced today as a ‘standard product’ bear the
                  W.C maker’s mark and (as of late 2015) retails in Malaysia for RM6,500. It seems I got a bargain at
                  £480 for my 1968 version.  Another piece of information I am missing is the date when this particular
                  mold was fashioned. I have seen quite a few Comyns cows for sale, but don’t know when – or by whom –
                  the first was fashioned. I would be delighted if someone could help me correct and fill in the holes
                  in this account.<u></u><u></u></p>

                <p>Going back to the start of the 20c, here is a creamer with Schuppe-like legs and fly, but a very
                  different approach to the head, horns, and stylized smooth udder.  It is Hallmarked for Daniel &amp;
                  John Wellby, London 1902 (hallmark entered 1896). This company was founded in 1827 by Joseph Clement
                  and John Wellby. The business was continued by Daniel and John Wellby at 57 King Street, Soho Square
                  and later at Garrick Street, Covent Garden. The firm was converted in 1896 into a limited liability
                  company under the style of D &amp; J Wellby Ltd.  The hallmarks on the belly appear somewhat worn,
                  but there are similar and clearer ones on the lid. </p>

                <p>Here are two Dutch creamers that I believe are mid-19c, albeit I haven’t found date marks on either.
                  Both have the lion passant with a ‘2’ below denoting .833 minimum purity silver (this mark was first
                  used in 1814), and both have traditional Schuppe-like legs. Neither has an export mark, so I assume
                  they were made for the Dutch market.  The one with the elevated fly, for which I have shown the belly
                  marks that I’ve not been able to identify, has a Minerva head with M (for Schoonhoven) on the lid. 
                  The one with the curly horns, red (presumably agate) eyes and simple aft-facing fly is most unusual
                  in that its head is removable – the only one like that I have ever seen. </p>

                  “H-H” is that of Herbert Hooijkaas who worked from 1943-1980 in Schoonhoven .which is renowned for
                  its silver.  The lion passant with the key is for 833 silver made for export, and the Minerva head
                  bears the M for Scoonhoven.</p>

                <p>This creamer and the next are also both made for export, but are considerably older.  This one bears
                  a whole lot of city or makers marks that I haven’t been able to identify, but is (problematically)
                  Dutch because there’s a (blurry) Minerva head on the lid. It’s import marked for London in 1891 by
                  Samuel Boyce Landeck of Campden Place.  I need some expert advice on this one, both regarding the
                  multitude of unidentified marks, and because Landeck is said by one web site to not have registered
                  until February 1902.  On the other hand, the very reliable Online Encyclopedia of Silver Marks,
                  Hallmarks and Makers Marks notes that Landek was a known imported of Hanau silver, and dates him in
                  London from 1879.  The multitude of marks (pseudo-marks most likely) would imply to me that this cow
                  is from Hanau rather than Holland but again I haven’t been able to identify them.</p>

                  definitely Dutch.  But…were there two SBL’s, and if not did Mr Landeck have a shop in Sheffield as
                  well as one in London, and use a slightly different importer’s mark for each?   Mysteries…or at

                  left, and facing rear on the cow in the middle; the flowery decorations remain, but somewhat
                  subdued.  The creamer on the left is German 800 silver and bears a couple marks I can’t identify. I

                  because it was attributed by the seller to Acquisto, and it came to her with a lot of other old
                  silver items from a ‘gorgeous Tynietoy mansion”.  There are two stories to tell here – the maker and
                  Tynietoy; as I found out some time later the seller was wrong about the first, but I have no reason
                  to doubt the quality of the collection from which it came.</p>
                <p>Based on the description of an identical miniature, I believe this cow was fashioned by Eugene
                  Kupjack, and is his Miniature Dollhouse Silver #353. From his obituary in the NY Times I learned that
                  Kupjack, who died in 1991 at the age of 79, over his lifetime fashioned more than  700 period-style
                  miniature rooms with 1/12 scale doll house furnishings. He is perhaps best known for the 30
                  shadow-box settings that were designed (and funded) by Narcissa Niblack Thorne, widow of a Montgomery
                  Ward &amp; Co heir. These were first displayed at the 1939 Worlds Fair, then donated to the Art
                  Institute of Chicago.  </p>
                <p>For those of you who aren’t dollhouse miniature aficionados, there’s a lot of info on the web about
                  Tynietoy. One good source is the Francis Clay Antiques site, where I learned “Tynietoy was a company
                  started by two talented women, Marion Perkins and Amy Vernon in about 1917 in Providence, Rhode
                  Island. They made miniature replicas of popular furniture designs in the styles representing Early
                  American through to the Victorian era. ...Over the years, or decades rather, leading to approximately
                  WWII the women grew the company to include other employees, craftsmen, and a huge line of miniature
                  furnishings. ...The miniature furniture was initially made independent of display spaces, but
                  eventually Tynietoy began making miniature replicas of New England style houses to sell along with
                  the furnishings.”  These days original Tynietoy houses and furniture make my cows seem inexpensive!</p>

                <p>Apparently there was a third silversmith&nbsp;cow-maker at the time, Robert Miller, as indicated by
                  this clipped add for James Robinson’s NY Old English Silver shop, from a 1926 edition of “The
                  Connoisseur”.&nbsp;It’s interesting that Miller’s creamer bear a family resemblance to Schuppe’s…and
                  also, that the Schuppe&nbsp;cow&nbsp;shown here has a heavier chest than do mine. Robinson’s is still
                  in business so I naturally asked them for more information, but they replied that it was too many
                  years ago for them to have any knowledge. What a shame. </p>

                  information on the card that Bruce included along with the cow tells you a bit about him and his
                  company, and you can learn more at www.bruce-russell.com.  While I normally don’t name my cow
                  creamers (I’d run out of names!) this lovely Guernsey cow automatically became ‘Snowflake’ when Bruce
                  personalized her for me in honor of her joining my family in Alaska.</p>

                <p><strong>Commissions from Veronica Shaw</strong> <strong>of England</strong></p>
                <p><br>
                  I started corresponding with Veronica Shaw after I bought one of her Schuppe copies on eBay. After a
                  number of emails, I asked her to design and make a silver cow creamer for me.  The result was
                  “Bluebell”, a heavy Modigliani-inspired “Auroch”-like lost-wax cast creamer, standing on a heavily
                  enameled base plate (which also, please note, bears the fly).  The patterning under the enamel is
                  designed to make it look like watered silk, and the cow is heavily chased.  The base bears her “VJS”
                  (Veronica Jane Shaw) makers mark, the lion rampant, 925 (it’s actually 958, Brittania Silver), the
                  Leopard Head assay, and the Queens Head special mark for 2002. The cow itself was assayed in 2003,
                  and bears simply the maker’s and assay marks.</p>
                <p>When I met Veronica during a quick trip to London a year or so later, she showed me a creamer she
                  had made for another patron (it’s on her web site).  I liked it so much I asked her to make a similar
                  one for me, and the result is the Dali-inspired Dalina, bearing a Schuppe head and modernistic body,
                  again on a beautifully enameled silver stand.  Dalina was assayed in London in 2004, and enjoys
                  looking at her dangling fly.  Later, my wife and I had the pleasure of hosting Veronica during her
                  trip to the US. </p>

                <p>This large bull is a silver version of a Peruvian ‘Torito de Pucara’. He was crafted for me by
                  virtually every artisan in the shop of this silversmithing company while my wife and I spent 3 days
                  visiting Machu Pichu and the area around Cusco.  It also appears in the Peru section of the Places
                  page along with more of an explanation of the Toritos.  This shop had all different kinds of lovely
                  silver jewelry and figures, but they had never before made a Torito de Pucara.  They probably thought
                  I was a bit strange for asking them to make one, but nevertheless willingly complied  (at US
                  $5/gram), went out and purchased a couple ceramic ones for a model, and this is the result.</p>

                  with him.  A well-traveled cow.  The smaller creamer in the middle bears the marks “Sterling,

                    are sufficiently clear that it’s a good example of Dutch hallmarking.  The lion passant with the
                    ‘2’ (which became a Roman II after 1953) is the symbol for .833 purity. The Medusa head with an
                    impressed letter indicates the assay office –  A for Amsterdam in this case – and the letter in the
                    circle is the date, in this case a slant M for 1947.  The sword mark on the tail – this style sword
                     was used from 1906-1953 – is a standard or purity mark used on pieces added to the base figure, or
                    too small for the lion.  There also is one on the inside of this creamer’s lid.  All this

                  1843.  The maker’s mark is partially obscured, but I’s guess it to be “HB”.  The larger cow has only
                  the “835” and an illegible maker’s mark.  It’s continental for sure, but whether Dutch, German of
                  whatever I really don’t know.  It is so similar to the one above and the smaller here however that
                  I’d guess Dutch, and again likely 19c.</p>

                  comparison.  It appears to have the MC maker’s mark, and certainly the aft-facing simple fly, face,
                  teats, garnet eyes, and body markings are remarkably similar.  It also has a very clear lion passant
                  with key (meaning .833 silver, made for export) and there seems to be (I need a better magnifying
                  glass!) a tiny mark under the lid that I believe to be an M, which would date this little fellow to
                  1922.  </p>

                <p> A knowledgeable seller kindly informed me that although I thought this was Dutch, it
                  is most likely from "Hanau, Germany, by B.Neresheimer &amp; Sohne...Hanau makers used elaborate marks
                  (pseudo marks) to stamp their silver. &quot; </p>
                <p>This is a good place to insert a few words about Hanau and Hanau Silver – derived largely from an
                  extensive write-up on the excellent web site of the Association of Small Collectors of Antique
                  Silver, ASCAS, at <a href="http://www.ascasonline.org/articolo13.html">http://www.ascasonline.org/articolo13.html</a>. 
                  Hanau is in Hesse, Germany, about 25 km east of Frankfurt am Main.  It addition to being the home
                  town of the Brothers Grimm and Franciscus Sylvius, from near the end of the 16c it became a center of
                  precious metal working when the local Count attracted Protestant Walloon refugees from France and the
                  Netherlands who brought their knowledge of jewelry and similar luxury goods with them. According to
                  the ASCAS article, however, the Hanau work in ‘antique silver’ for which it is noted today –
                  masterful copies as well as original pieces, at least for the next several decades – didn’t really
                  begin until the 1860s when the silversmith August Schleissner relocated there after spells in Paris,
                  Germany and the US, then returned to Hanau and with his brother took over the Schleissner company and
                  started a line of antique reproduction silver that because extremely popular with royalty and the
                  rich.  The other leading firm for this type of silverware was Neresheimer, founded in 1890 (and the
                  maker of this and several of my other Hanau creamers).  Like Schleissner, Neresheimer’s workshop
                  produced extremely high quality goods, both reproductions and original pieces.  Much of his work
                  bears the import names or marks for his London agent Berthold Mueller, or Bucholz &amp; Zelt
                  (B&amp;Z) and Tiffany &amp; Co. in the US.  The success of such high quality firms led to a rapid
                  growth in the number of antique silver producers in Hanau starting in the very late 19c, and the
                  resulting frenzied  competition led to a decrease in the quality of workmanship and the introduction
                  of mass produced items , which – together with the Hanau  practice of  using ‘fantasy’ or spurious
                  marks often made to look like the guild marks from pieces that they copied – earned the later Hanau
                  silver a quite dubious reputation.  This cow and the next one down are from Neresheimer and, at least
                  to my eye, are representative of the early very high quality work of that firm.  </p>

                <p>This is another Neresheimer cow, a lovely small example. This firm was noted for the quality of its
                  reproductions.  It’s readily identifiable as theirs by the script ‘n’,  and the chevron pseudomark;
                  chevrons were part of the Hanau crest as well as the older Hanau city mark.  I don’t have any idea
                  about the third mark – the one that looks like a sideways capital “D” – it could be a date mark, but
                  then there were a variety of those in different countries, and I’ve not heard that Neresheimer had
                  its own set.</p>

                <p>These three were sold to me as a ‘set’, by a chap who had inherited them from his grandfather who
                  had acquired them on a trip to Germany, presumably in the early 1900s (before WWI).  The pseudo-marks
                  again identify them as from Hanau, although in this case I haven’t been able to identify the maker. 
                  For those with further interest, I can suggest three sources. The first is the Online Encyclopedia of
                  Silver marks, hallmarks, and makers marks,  <a href="http://www.925-1000.com/">www.925-1000.com</a>, 
                  which has a special page devoted to Hauau pseudo marks. The second is articles by Dorothes Bustyn on
                  “The Antique Silver Industry of Hanau”, which can be found on the web site of the Association of
                  Small Collectors of Antique Silver, <a href="http://www.ascasonline.org/">www.ascasonline.org</a>.
                  The third is the section on Hanau hallmarks on the related site, <a href="http://www.silvercollection.it/">www.silvercollection.it</a>. 
                  Quoting briefly from there, “Mark stamping as practiced in Hanau would have been completely illegal
                  in France or England, or for that matter in any other German city where a guild supervised the
                  marking. But Hanau had a long tradition as a free-trade city. With the production of &quot;antique
                  silver&quot;, Hanau found a market niche, which brought its silver manufacturers enormous prosperity
                  and worldwide reputation. The 'father' of this industry was August Schleissner. The other leading
                  firm of Hanau was Neresheimer, founded in 1890 as a partnership of August and Ludwig Neresheimer with
                  Jean Schlingloff.”</p>

                <p>This rather fierce looking cow is unmarked, but said by the seller from Luzern Switzerland to be
                  cast German 800 silver from ~1890-1900. It comes with the story that it came from the household of
                  Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (Victoria Eugenie Julia Ena; 24 October 1887 – 15 April 1969) who (per
                  Wikkipedia) “was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Spanish_consorts" title="List of Spanish consorts">Queen
                    of Spain</a> from 1906 to 1931 as the wife of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain"

                    title="Sophia of Prussia">Queen Sophia of Greece</a>.”  The seller stated that though he has no
                  written confirmation to back this story up, he believes it to be true beause he acquired it “through
                  a friend who recently cleared the house of the Queen's housekeeper…her relative said that she (the
                  housekeeper) was allowed to select a few items to keep when the Queen died in Lausanne, Switzerland
                  in 1969, and that this was one of those items.”  He didn’t advertise the cow this way, but passed
                  this on when I inquired about its provenance – so I believe it too, because I had already bought it
                  and he had no reason to feed me –so to speak – a line of bull. Gee, perhaps I now have a royal cow!
                   It addition to the story, I particularly likethis creamer because of its very unusual  shape, and
                  the fact that its lid (with the tip of its tail) lifts off rather than being hinged.  True story or
                  not, the cow is indeed unique and quite lovely..</p>

                  leopard-head London assay, as well as the Garrard stamp.  This company was founded by silversmith
                  George Wickes (1698-1761) in London in 1735 and underwent several name and partnership changes before
                  becoming Garrard &amp; Co @1802.  Queen Victoria bestowed the honor of Crown Jeweler on Garrard in
                  1843, a responsibility they retained until 2007.  They amalgamated with the Goldsmiths and
                  Silversmiths Co. Ltd in 1952, which was taken over in turn by Mappin &amp; Webb (established in 1797)
                  in 1959. <A href="http://www.antiquesilverspoons.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.antiquesilverspoons.co.uk</A>
                  notes that in the early 60’s Mappin &amp; Webb combined with Walker and Hall and Elkington  &amp; Co.
                  and are still active today as retailers under the auspices of British Silverware Ltd.” 
                  Interestingly, Wikipedia has a somewhat different version of their recent history, noting that
                  Garrard demerged in 2002, then was acquired by the US private equity firm Yucaipa Cos. in 2006 (which
                  may explain why they are no longer the crown jewelers…).  Can someone correct or verify all this??

                  late 19c, but they certainly date from after 1868 when the Germans standardized the national hallmark
                  to be a crescent moon and crown (Halbmond und Krone).  They bear these and the 925 mark on the tail,
                  as well as a standing lion.  One of them is also stamped for “Germany”, presumably meaning it was
                  made for export (I got the one without that stamp directly from Germany – so some of these apparently

                <p>Here is a finely done, modern chased cow creamer.  It bears a London import mark
                  and 1961 date mark, both “sterling” and .925, and a very nice maker’s mark for “J R &amp;
                  Co Ld” in a four-leaf clover shape.  The seller indicated that he thought that might be
                  for John Round, but that’s very unlikely given the date. I have however been unable to
                  identify the maker. Help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

                  “B&amp;Z, 800, GERMANY”, and an unidentifiable maker’s mark. B&amp;Z stands for Bucholz &amp; Zelt,
                  US importers located at 22 W 48th St, New York (an Otto Bucholz &amp; Co  of 1170 Broadway traded as
                  early as 1904, and was still around – advertising in the Jeweler’s Circular – in 1920; I haven’t yet
                  found out when the name changed, or rather when Mr Zelt became a partner and the B&amp;Z firm was
                  established, and whether it was Otto or some other Bucholz that joined with him.  B&amp;Z imported a
                  lot of Hanau silver, much from J.D. Schleissner &amp; Sohne, but the maker’s mark on these, as well
                  as the other one I have from B&amp;Z, is badly blurred [&amp; Schleissner used a whole flock of
                  different ones].  The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 required the name of the country of origin to be
                  stamped on imports…and in 1914 this was amended to include the words “Made In”.  My best guess
                  therefore is that these are Hanau silver, certainly imported prior to WWI</p>

                  Meyers (1887-1958).  I learned a bit about him from a November 2011 article in Antiques and Auction
                  News which discussed the forthcoming sale of his personal collection of his work, including dollhouse
                  miniatures. That article notes that he “was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the first of five
                  children born to a German father and Polish mother, and moved to New York City with his family when
                  he was ten. He exhibited artistic ability as a child, and with the encouragement of his art teacher,
                  he initially considered a career as a designer for a wallpaper company until it was discovered he was
                  color-blind. He also had ambition to be an actor and after graduating in 1907 from City College of
                  New York, he toured the deep South with a dramatic company and developed a vaudeville act. He
                  returned to New York after impassioned entreaties from his family, and upon his return, he began a
                  four-year apprenticeship with a German silversmith in lower Manhattan.” He became interested in sales
                  as well as design while working for the Wilcox-Roth Company in Newark, New Jersey. In 1913 he bought
                  the company and changed its name the William B. Meyers Company. It remained in business for over 50
                  years. He started making miniatures for his own pleasure in the late 1920s, and continued doing so
                  till his wife died in 1947 at which time he focused on religious sterling hollowware.  I have no idea
                  of the date of this pair of his creamers other than they must be from before 1947, but they are
                  extremely well done. </p>

                  through eBay in 2000.  Its markings are a lot of fun…In one direction there’s a “KS” surrounded by
                  three dots for Karl Schatz of <SPAN id="lw_1233883001_2">Hanau</SPAN> who was active in the 1st
                  quarter of the 20th century (info courtesy of the Online Encyclopedia of Silver Marks…), and 930
                  silver.  The German crown and crescent mark are absent although they were supposed to be compulsory
                  after 1888, presumably because it was made expressly for a British importer.  The marks in the other
                  direction show that it was imported into the UK (the ‘u’ in the circle is the British import mark
                  used since 1906) in 1912 (that’s the “r”)  by “R.L” (which is right in the middle of the camera
                  reflection), whom I can’t identify, and it is considered sterling by the Brits (925).  Someone has
                  also scratched “O8W” – or more likely “M&amp;O” into the bottom.  No idea what that is…</p>

                  Bucholz &amp; Zelt, thus the “B&amp;Z”.  It would also appear to bear the half-moon &amp; crown, but
                  that’s a bit hard to distinguish and it could easily be  Hanau pseudo mark  A couple more imported by
                  B&amp;Z follow…apparently small silver cow creamers were popular in New York City in the early

                <p>This very tiny but delightful little guy is a bit of a cheat for the collection since instead of

                  was probably a snuff box.  His marks are interesting since they’re both outside on the neck and on
                  the inside rim.  Outside, the F is the British import mark used from 1867-1904.  The lion passant
                  stands for sterling, and the T=1894.  These are repeated and the English Leopard head added inside,
                  and on the other side is the mark of the importer, DB for David Bridge, General Manager of John
                  George Smith &amp; Co., Manufacturers, who imported a lot of silver items, many from Germany although

                <p>My wife bought this lovely hammered silver pitcher for me during a visit to Dublin in 1997.  The
                  marks show a London assay, 1979.  The maker’s mark is HM which, thanks to a reader of my site, I have
                  learned is for  Hector Miller (born 1945), an eminent London silversmith who trained at Stuart
                  Devlin's workshop..  I learned from a similar pitcher that recently came up for sale on eBay that
                  these were made for the Centenary of the Jersey Cow Society of the UK, which was founded in 1878. 
                  Their web page notes that “Jersey cattle originate from Jersey, the largest Island in the Channel
                  Islands and just some 14 miles away from the French coast. There are fewer than 6000 Jerseys on the
                  Island in total with nearly 4000 of these being adult milking cows. The purity of the breed on the
                  Island is maintained by a strict ban on imports. This ban has been in place for some 150 years. There
                  are no other breeds of the cattle on the Island. The Jersey shares a common ancestry with not only
                  the Guernsey breed but also those cattle found on the Normandy and Brittany coasts. This type of
                  cattle is believed to have originally travelled up across Europe from the Middle East. Jerseys are
                  known to exist in the UK mainland since 1741 and probably well before. At that time they were known
                  as Alderney's .”  The folks that live on the island are rightly proud of their breed and Jersey cow
                  creamers, appropriately labeled but of many styles, are (or at least were) popular souvenirs. You’ll
                  find a small herd of them on the Advertising and Souvenirs page.</p>

                I almost hate to put this lovely creamer on a stand so far down the page, but it issignificantly
                different than the others because it’s silver plated rather than solid silver. It’swell marked for the
                maker, George Richmond Collis, who in 1835 took over the firm ofSir Edward Thomason at 28 Church
                Street, Birmingham, moving in 1868 to CambridgeStreet. In 1854 Collis opened a branch at 130 Regent
                Street, London. The firm wasabsorbed by S.W. Smith &amp;amp; Co in 1888. This creamer is clearly marked
                for the Londonaddress, and I need to do more homework to interpret the rest of the marks and gain more
                information. I’ve shown it next to an electroplated nickel silver one by PT&amp;;Co (no further info)
                since it bears a family resemblance although with clear differences.

                  King George, but then again there are no numbers so even if so it’d be hard to say which one.</p>
