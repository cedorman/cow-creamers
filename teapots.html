          <h1>Teapots</h1>


          <p>The teapot part of the collection started somewhat accidentally, when I had to buy a teapot in order to
            get a cow creamer that I wanted.&nbsp; Then – just like with the silver and Staffordshire cow creamers – when we moved
            to England for a couple years, things changed.&nbsp; I think the one that really got me hooked on cow
            teapots was Andy Titcomb’s ‘Bull in a China Shop’ (see below…), which we found in a lovely tea shop on Neal
            Street, just north of Covent Gardens. But then, if it hadn’t been one of his, it probably would have been
            one of the others.&nbsp; So now there are over two hundred twenty five, most here, some shown in other theme sections.  </p>

                  hand crafted by Carol E. Myers of Chincoteague Island, Va.&nbsp; She makes a number of other animal
                  teapots as well.  Her shop was closed when we visited the island for a birding trip in 2015, so I’m
                  very glad I bought these while she was still working.</p>

                  Crews Dunn of The Sylvan Studios, Keysville (<a href="http://ccdunn.starlogic.com/">http://ccdunn.startlogic.com</a>). 
                  A friend pointed me to the marvelous hand-thrown and carved ‘effigy’ animal pots on her web site, and
                  unsurprisingly I felt compelled to add her work to my collection. So…I contacted her and commissioned
                  these four teapots – a Texas Longhorn, an Angus bull, and the Jersey and Holstein – as well as two
                  creamers.  These pots are quite large and heavy, so my wife and I elected to drive to Keysville to
                  pick them up after our stay in Chincoteague, and we had a delightful time meeting Christy, learning a
                  bit more about her history and technique, and touring her studio.  </p></blockquote>

                  well as his fanciful and beautifully crafted teapots. Wikipedia tells us that Tokoname was the

                  the 12c. Ceramics production and commercial fishing are major components of the local economy. </p>

              <td scope="col">
                <p>This large (8”x12”) and beautiful cow teapot was an early design of  Paul Cardew’s, dating from the
                  1980’s when he was trading as South West Ceramics.  He is probably better known among cow teapot
                  aficiandos for his bottles with a cow head sticking out, shown with some more information about him
                  a few sections down. I acquired this lovely “Milka” cow (via eBay) from Sue Blayze of Tea Pot Island. I believe she holds the world record for teapot
                  collections – she has some 6400 of which 1600 or so are displayed and discussed on her marvelous
                  website, <a href="http://www.teapotisland.com" target="_blank">www.teapotisland.com</a>.  If you are
                  at all interested in teapots, this is a must-visit site.  She noted that this one is ‘rare’ – I had
                  earlier bought one that broke in shipment (lousy packaging) from a chap who said there were only 250
                  made – but that it was also made in brown and black.  I suppose this one could go in “the
                  “Advertising” section since it’s a lovely rendition of the Milka purple cow and proudly bears the
                  brand name. For those of you that don’t know Milka, well, you’re missing something very tasty.</p></td>

                  the Cardew Design North America Inc (established in 1999 to increase business in the US and Canada)
                  website we learn that Paul Cardew attended art school at Loughborough University, then taught art
                  part time at Exeter University. He broke into commercial work with successful commissions for ceramic
                  brooches for Harrods and piggy banks for the National Westminster Bank, then launched his teapot
                  designs in 1975 at the Birmingham spring fair. His initial company,
                  Sunshine Ceramics (we learn from Andy Titcomb’s website that Sunshine Ceramics was started by Paul
                  along with his wife Karen, and Hillary Watters and her partner David Symonds, and that Andy joined
                  them in 1978 and left in 1983), transitioned into Cardew Design in 1991, and they entered North
                  American markets in 92. Cardew has designed for a number of well known brands including Portmerion
                  and Royal Dalton, but most famously for Disney for which he did over a hundred designs. The North
                  America company acquired the international rights to the Cardew name and trademarks in 2008,
                  and continues to produce new designs.</p>

          <p>This ‘beauty’ is signed and marked for John Groth, ’87.  It comes up on occasion on eBay, usually with a
            high reserve (mine didn’t, thankfully; one of my few ‘good deals’).  He has a web site – johngrothglass.com
            – that features fused glass and clay, for which he holds a patent.  That site doesn’t give much of his
            history, but elsewhere I’ve found that he started working in ceramics in 1970, developed a
            thermal-shock-resistant version of porcelain in 1985, and started fusing glass and clay in 1986.  His web
            site does show a number of teapots (but not this one) and other ceramic items, but all are dated 1997 or
            earlier so I assume he now focuses on his fused glass pieces.

	  <p>This is a very interesting Chinese purple clay tea set.  The golden horned bull is the teapot - almost (close enough).  Actually you put the tea in the strainer that sits on his houlders, pour in hot water, and the tea drains down through a second strainer into his head and out his mouth into the waiting little pitcher. Then you pour it from that into the 8 little cups.    It came from Shenzhen, China. At $190 not cheap, but sufficiently unique and clver, not to mention nice, that I couln;t resist. </p></blockquote></td>

          <p>This is my favorite of the ‘mass produced’ teapots, strange as it may be. I’ve been looking for one by
            this maker for a very long time.  It’s Gzhel, a high quality Russian ceramic which takes its name from the
            village and surrounding area of Gzhel southeast of Moscow, that has been producing distinctive blue and
            white pottery since 1802 (there’s a nice little article about it on Wikipedia, as well as several other
            descriptions on various web sites).  My wife and I have several lovely pieces of Gzhel that we purchased
            during our visits to Russia, but I had never seen a cow (though I looked long and hard) until this one
            turned up on eBay.  The seller notes that she bought it from the Gzhel factory store in Vladivostok while
            she was at the US consulate there between 2000 and 2002.  I am absolutely delighted to add it to my
            collection.</p></blockquote>

                 <p>Seemingly identical, these three teapots have somewhat different histories. The one on the right, which
            came to me from Germany, is stamped for “Erphila, Germany” and bears the mold mark 718. Erphila ia the mark
            used by Ebeling and Reuss, a giftware importer and distributor founded in 1886 in Philadelphia (thus
            E…R…Phila) and sold to Strathmore Corp in 2002, on porcelain and art work imported from Europe. The
            Erphila, Germany mark would indicate that it was made by Porzellanfabrik Carl Schumann of Arzburg Bavaria
            which traces its history to 1876 and closed in 1994 (see PM&amp;M,
            www.porcelainmarksandmore.com/bavaria/arzberg_2/00.php). Apparently in spite of the Erphila mark it never
            made it out of Germany, or somehow it made a return trip. The cow on the left bears the same mold mark but
            also a conjoined “AK” and the word foreign, which indicates it was imported for sale into the UK, which is
            where I got it. The middle teapot looks very similar but has a different mold mark and is both stamped and
            has a sticker for Cortendorf, the Bavarian city (today Coburg-Cortendorf) where (from PM&amp;M)
            Porzellanfabrik Julius Griesbach operated from 1890 until the factory was taken over by Goebel in 1973.
            Interestingly, most Cortendorf teapots like this were sold unmarked to Ebeling and Reuss, but pretty
            obviously this one was sold into the US under the Cortendorf label. Not only was this an apparently popular
            German-made animal teapot, but…</p>

            continued as Price Bros (Burslem) Ltd at Top Bridge Works, Longport &amp; the Albion Works, Burslem from

            treapot was used by them from 1934 till 1961. The Japanese also seem to have gotten into the act with
            somewhat similar teapots, although their interpretation shown here is simply stamped Made in Japan.<br>

	  <p> Another black and white rectangular set of teapot, creamer sand sugar.  This one is from Department 56, which per their web site began in the mid 1970s as a department in a large retail florist in Minneapolis. They initially specialized in Christmas or snow viillages, later added 'Snowbabies' and over the years have expanded into other  giftware and collectible schlock.  The history page of their website gives you a year by year breakdown of their expansion, through acquitition by a NY iunvestment firm in 1992 to ultimately became a  part of the huge ENESCO falify of 'stuff' peddlers in 2009.  They  give a nice short history of ENESCO which I copy here: " Enesco's International Headquarters is located in Itasca, Ill. ENESCO was founded in 1958 as the import division of N. Shure Company, one of the largest and oldest general merchandise catalog companies. Following N. Shure's sale to Butler Brothers, the import division reorganized as Enesco Corporation, formed from the phonic spellings of the prior parent company's name initials - N.S.Co. Enesco was sold four times, culminating in 2007 when substantially all of Enesco's assets were sold to Tinicum Capital Partners II, LLP, a private investment partnership. Enesco then became a privately-held company and changed its legal name to Enesco, LLC." They then add that ENESCO was bought by a LA pruvate equity firm, Balmoral Funds, in 2015. Through all of this Dept 56 has kept on keeping on with its seasonal items and snowbabies. They didn't make  a lot of cows, but have turned out a few.  There is a unmarked pitcher similar to these on that page.</p>

            although unmarked, is most likely Thames of Japan based on the red clay, frosted brown coloring and gold
            knobs on the horns. The white and purple set with the big flat red noses bears the red and gold stickers of
             “Lipper and Mann Creations, Japan”.  This company was founded in April 1946 as an importer of glass and
            ceramics from Czechoslovakia and other European companies. They had a showroom on 5th Avenue in NY, and
            sold to department stress and other retail outlets.  They began importing from Japan in 1947, and I’d
            imagine that this set dates from around then. There was a period when ugly was popular… Mr. Lipper bought
            out Mr. Mann in 1963, and the company since then has been Lipper International; their website from which I

          <p>The lovely, simple little Yixing purple clay teapot on the right here came to me from Hong Kong. Yixing
            clay teapots are quite popular these days because their unglazed surfaces absorb traces of the tea,
            creating a more complex flavor…but for that same reason they should always be used with the same variety of
            tea, and never washed with soap. This type of clay derives its name from the location where it’s found, a
            region near the city of Yixing in Jiangsu Province. The Wikipedia article about it states that its use
            dates back to the Song dynasty. Its companion teapot on the left arrived from a much less exotic place –
            Texas – although the seller was Chinese. It’s delightfully unusual in that the cow or water buffalo head
            embellishes the handle rather than serving as a spout.</p>

          <p>Here are four quite similar water buffalo interpretations in jade or stone. Given the nature of the material they must
            have been carved as opposed to molded, but whether by hand or machine it’s impossible to say.  In the
            picture of three, the dark one with the pug nose and a round knob on the lid was sold as “Tibetan Jade” and
            came from Hong Kong. The green one with a gourd on the lid – sold as Chinese jade – came from Wuhan, Hubei,
            and its black companion from Zhaenghou, Henan. The orange one on the little wooden stand is quite similar
            to the black one with the gourd, and I found it in an antique mall in Annapolis MD.   I seriously doubt
            that these have any practical purpose other than decoration (and earning a bit of money for the carvers),
            albeit they do hold liquid and pour through the mouth. </p></blockquote>

The water buffalo are nearly identical in shape and size, but the lids and coloration are obviously very different. Like many folks my age I had been in VN in the early 70s...but hardly in Hanoi, and not for science,  so this was a treat.</p>

        <td scope="col">These two are from identical molds, but one is said to be Tibetan

          tree and the boy on the lid.  The boy with the flute riding a water buffalo or
          bull is a traditional Zen Buddhist theme – you can read more about this on the
          Suiteki page.  The copper teapot here was somewhat corroded so I took a bit of
          polish to it – it also has a considerable amount of solidified material of some
          sort inside, so I doubt that it was really used just for tea. Both came via eBay
          from Nanyang City, Henan, China; interestingly the seller had simultaneously
          listed the silver one for $ and the copper one for £, probably not expecting
          some foolish collector to search ‘worldwide’ and decide to get both. </td>
