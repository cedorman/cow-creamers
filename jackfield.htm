        <h1 align="left"><a id="h1"></a>Jackfield</h1>
      <p>Jackfield is a small village on the south bank of the River  Severn, in the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire,   England.  According to a local webpage (<a href="http://www.jackfieldfestival.com/">www.jackfieldfestival.com</a>), mining  and pottery manufacture were well established there as early as the mid-15th  century.  From what I have been able to  glean from the web, Jackfield has two main claims to fame in pottery, one being  that it is a noted center for decorative wall and floor tiles (there is a  Jackfield Tile Museum), and the second a glossy black glaze which is what  characterizes these cow creamers.  The  Glass and Pottery Sellers Association Newsletter of June 2005 notes:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> “Jackfield wares originated in the town of Jackfield, in Shropshire, England,  in 1740 to 1780. The original earthenware was a thin-walled gray to  purplish-black clay, and covered in a glossy black lead glaze. It was also  known as <em>jet ware</em>, <em>blackware</em>, or <em>japanned</em> ware,  after the Japanese black lacquer pieces. In addition to the goods made in  Jackfield, it was also produced by Thomas Whieldon in Staffordshire, Wedgwood,  and others. The pieces made by Whieldon have a more reddish colored body.  Shards of this pottery found in Maryland  and Florida  have led historians to possible early English settlements where little other  documentation exists.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Both in  the UK  antique shops that I have visited and on eBay, the term Jackfield seems to be  applied to earthenware cow creamers with the shiny black glaze, that are quite  similar in many cases to the other ‘Staffordshire’ ones in the sense of having  a lid and usually being on an oval base. They presumably date from the late  19c or early 20c, i.e., the Victorian era, or at least are sold as such.  I have a feeling that some of mine are earlier (and likely some much later!),  but have really no way of sorting most them either by date or by locale of  manufacture.  Per usual, I’d appreciate  any further information anyone can provide on the ones in my collection, or on  ‘Jackfield’ cow creamers in general.</p>
		
      <p>While the one in the first section below seems (based on my shopping in England as well as what apprears frequently on eBay) to be the 'classic' and most common version of a Jackfield cow creamer, they do come in an assortmant of shapes, and a whole lot of variants within each of those themes. All however seem to have more or less oval bases,  relatively simple lids, and gold decorations although those have frequently been rubbed off in whole or part through use. I should also repeat an earlier note on price: They were rather dear and somewhat scarce in (50 GBP and up) in English antique stores when I lived there in the mid 90's, once ebay kicked in the value has plummeted simply because there are so many of them. Seems like everyone's grandmother or great grandmother had one, and the modern generation has little fondness for such keepsakes. There are generally dozens for offer on ebay at any given time.</p>

I was excited to get my first one from a small antique shop in the English countryside, and paid 110 GBP for it. I remember the dealer's wife asking him if he really wanted to part with it.  That could have been part of a sales pitch, although I had already agreed to buy it so I tend to think she rather liked it herself.  Now, if I had only known at the time what ebay was going to bring...  </p></td>

The horns and ears also are somewhat  different than the others, its lid is rounded, and it has no raised flower on  the base, so it presumably was made by a different pottery.</p></td>

          <p>These Jackfield  creamers were apparently very popular as souvenirs – presumably during the  Victorian era.  They bear in gold script  “A Present From …” on the left side, and the triple slash marks on the  right.  These three are from Skegness,  Abertillery, and (right side to camera) Teignmouth (the pair are also shown in  the Ads and Souveniers theme). Their mold is similar to the one on the right in  the picture of four creamers – rounded lid, flat base top, and prominent udder  and teats, although I have modestly (actually unintentionally) obscured them in  these photos.</p>            </td>

            <p>Here are two more from the same mold: one from Penzance with faded gold, and a very pristine one that has the greeting on the right instead of the left, and simply reads “From the Potteries”.  It’s real hard to get a good picture of the gold on these, so I took these outside (albeit it was snowing that day, 5 May…)</p></td></tr>

            <p>This creamer could and perhaps should go on the  Staffordshire page but I decided to put it here in spite of the Rockingham or  treacle glaze, as an example of one that’s nearly identical in shape to many of  the souvenir black Jackfield cows like those above and that bears a similar  marking: “A Present from Aberystwyth”.   Whether it is really from one of the Jackfield potteries I have no way  of knowing – and of course molds were passed around or copied quite a bit.</p>

            <p>Did I really need another Jackfield  cow? This is my 32nd…but then I hadn’t bought one for ~3 years, this  one is in very good condition, and it is a bit different.  Its base and body (including small udder and  distinct teats, as well as the gold decoration) appear to be identical to the  ‘Present’ cows shown above. However the head is different – smaller ears,  shortened face with wide open mouth, and horns curled straight forward. Plus,  since there are so many of these Jackfield cows available these days – lots of  folks trying to offload great-grandma’s stuff – the price was eminently  reasonable. </p></td>

            <p>I’m not sure I should put these   creamers in this section since the style is a rather common one – see the   21st section down in <SPAN id="lw_1234746246_7">Staffordshire</SPAN> – but the glaze and gold is definitely   Jackfield, and they were made of the typical purplish-black clay. The two in the   pair both had significant damage (thus were very inexpensive) which I restored –   one just to the lid and the other both the lid and the upper lip.  Came out   pretty well for an amateur…At one time they both has gold writing on the left   side – “A Present from Pothyport” best I can make out from the remaining faint   traces,  although I can’t find a town by that name.</p></td>

As noted elsewhere, this stule of creamer was quite popular and widely produced. Thus I don't know if these came from a pottery in Staffordshire or are actually from Jackfield, but since theyare made from the purplish black clay, I will assume the latter until corrected.   </p></td>
