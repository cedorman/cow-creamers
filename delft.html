          <h1>Delft</h1>

          <p> Wikipedia tells us that “Delft is a city and municipality in the province of South Holland, Netherlands.
            Delft is a popular tourist attraction, home to Delft University of Technology regarded as center of
            technological research and development in the Netherlands, Delft Blue pottery, and the currently reigning
            House of Orange-Nassau...Delftware or Delft pottery, also known as Delft Blue (Dutch: Delfts blauw), is a
            general term now used for Dutch tin-glazed earthenware, a form of faience. Most of it is blue and white
            pottery, and the city of Delft in the Netherlands was the major centre of production, but the term covers
            wares with other colours, and made elsewhere. It is also used for similar pottery that it influenced made
            in England, but this should be called English delftware to avoid confusion.”</p>

          <p>From the website of De Delftse Pauw, <a href="http://www.delftsepauw.com/">http://www.delftsepauw.com/</a>,
            we learn that
            : </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“In the sixteenth century, in a number of Dutch towns, factories were established which among their
              items produced &quot;Majolica&quot;. This &quot;Majolica&quot; was made with a tin-glaze and found its
              origins in Italy and Spain. The Dutch East Indian Company began importing porcelain from China in the
              seventeenth century. This porcelain, especially the blue and white became very popular.
              “The &quot;Majolica&quot; producing factories started at a certain moment to imitate this Chinese
              porcelain, because of several reasons. The imported Chinese porcelain meant competition. Civil war in
              China made that imports from China went down. Customers asked for specific items which due to distance
              took a long time to deliver and due to language problems the delivered item was not always what was
              ordered. In Delft, in the seventeenth century 32 factories were producing Delftware. One of them was a
              factory called &quot;de Paauw&quot;. These factories were often established in beer breweries which had
              stopped their production. In the nineteenth century due to competition from other factories like
              Wedgewood in England and lack of innovations, the highlight of Delftware had come to a close. Nowadays in
              Delft only a few companies still produce the entirely handpainted traditional Delftware. One of these
              companies is &quot;de Delftse Pauw&quot;. A company which is very loyal to this tradition.” </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Delft City website (<a href="http://www.delft.nl/">www.delft.nl</a>) features a number of factories
            that produce the famous pottery; for example the Royal Delft factory, Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles, dating
            from 1653, claims to be the only one that has remained operational in the city since the 17c.  Their Royal
            Delft web site shows colorations that range from the traditional blue to polychrome, pinjacker (red, blue
            and gold decorations, based on Japanese Imari), and black. </p>

          <P>My collection has a few older or at least reproduction traditional Delft Blue cow creamers. However most
            of the really great early Dutch pieces featuring cows are figurines not creamers, so as lovely as they are
            they haven’t made it to my collection. Although as noted on the ‘history’ page the Dutch were likely the
            first to fashion cow creamers, none that I am aware of were decorated in the ‘Delft’ style. On the other
            hand, that style or at least the coloration and decoration of Delft ware became so popular that it was
            widely adopted by potteries that were making cow creamers in the 19c and early 20c, so many of the fine
            pieces of what I am calling here ‘Delft’ were actually made in Germany or England. In addition, little cow
            creamers (as well as many other Delft pieces) make great souvenirs and tin-glazed earthenware is expensive
            so almost all of the ‘tourist type’ items, widely available in the city of Delft, are simply decorated in
            underglaze blue on a cheap white clay body. Even the term ‘Delft’ is no guarantee that a piece if from
            there, since the term isn’t copyrighted and as Wikipedia noted has come to mean the style more than the
            actual city. So in many cases despite the markings, the very recent ones come from Japan or China. Some
            with ’Delft’ like decorations and style are even souvenirs of other places – not least Holland, Michigan
            for example.</p>

                  <p>This is my one and only cow creamer that has, I believe, a legitimate claim to be early Delft
                    Blauw - a lovely example from the late 19c.  From what the seller said, the marks attribute this
                    creamer to the Gebr. (brothers) Tichelaar factory, circa 1880-1895; currently named Tichelaars
                    Koninklijke Makkumer Aardewerk-en Tegelfabriek (Royal Tichelaar Makkum).  This supposedly was the
                    first mark that they used.  They have a neat website with an English version (start at <a href="http://www.tichelaar.nl/shop/ceramics.php">http://www.tichelaar.nl/shop/ceramics.php</a>)
                    , from which I learned that “On a Spanish map from 1572, today’s location of Royal Tichelaar
                    Makkum’s factory is already marked ‘bricaria’: a brickyard. It is the oldest proof of the company’s
                    more than four centuries of uninterrupted ceramic history. By 1670, domestic pottery had replaced
                    bricks as core business and from 1890 Royal Tichelaar Makkum concentrated on ornamental
                    earthenware. The family company owes its continuity up to the present day to its appreciation of
                    tradition, though with an eager eye for innovation.”  They do have some cows on their web site
                    shop, but none that are creamers…and given the current prices for the new ones, the amount I paid
                    for this old beauty makes it a great bargain. </p>

                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span id="lw_1230832369_3">www.sephari.com</span></a> – we learn was
                  founded by Roelof Elshout in 1920, as an offshoot of the Potterie Rembrandt in Nijmegen.  The factory
                  passed to his brother Hugo, then to Hugo’s daughter Cora in 1988.  In 1996 the company was
                  incorporated into Aardwerkfabirek’t  Delftshce Huys B.V., and moved to Waddinxveen where it still
                  manufactures earthenware products (albeit I can't find any cow creamers on its web page).  I don’t know the age of these creamers, but they certainly date
                  from before 1968 when the company switched from the hand-painted mark (a stylized <span id="lw_1230832369_4">potters
                    wheel</span>) to a printed version.  Oud Delft is noted for using an opaque white glaze with no tin
                  or lead oxide, to mimic a tin-glazed look, over the white biscuit of modern Delftware.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Here are two more Oud Delft cow creamers from mold 795. At least the one on the left is that for sure since it has the company's marks like the blue one above. It is also dated, for May 1963. The one on the right is a bit more of a mystery -  it is from the same or an identical mold, but has a different, duller glaze(probably tin), and a much rougher texture to the ceramic.  The base
                  bears the initials AL, but the maker’s mark is missing and appears
                  from scratch marks to have been scraped or chipped off.  Why someone would deliberately obliterate it
                  I don’t know…perhaps it was considered a ‘second’ and the makers wanted to make sure it didn’t carry
                  their mark?  If so, it isn’t clear to me what the problem may have been.  The seller, from the UK,
                  marketed it as Faience, probably Angouleme, @19c; since she sells mostly Faience, and that term
                  basically means tin-glazed earthenware, so I believe she was mistaken. If not, then perhaps Oud Delft has copied a French cow!</p><blockquote>

					<p>Here’s a nice and unusual rendition that I believe to be quite modern, and is at any
                    rate different from many of my other Delft creamers – assuming, that is, that it really is Delft
                    since many with that moniker refer more to the style of decoration than the locale of manufacture.
                     It’s hard to know for sure (although it was sold as vintage Delft), since its only markings are
                    “15” and “F” written in blue, and it cane to me from exotic Arizona. The three flowers with yellow
                    centers on each side are a nice touch, as are the bright red nostrils, small teats, and ‘lips’.
                    Looks like it’s wearing lipstick. It is nicely made, with a small lid that bears the tip of the

                  sense of humor since he colored the inside of the ears blue. Wikipedia tells us that "The Regina
                  pottery factory, Kunstaardewerkfabriek Regina, existed from 1898 to 1979. Located in Gouda, the
                  factory was established in Queen Wilhelmina's coronation year 1898, hence the name Regina, Latin for
                  "queen". Initially, the company made earthenware tobacco pipes, like almost all Gouda pottery
                  factories. The factory was founded by Gerrit Frederik van der Want, a descendant of the Gouda pottery
                  family Van der Want, and Georges Antidthoine Alexis Barras, a Belgian lender and art collector."
                  These two, like almost all Regina pottery pieces, bear the founder's initials, WB. </p><blockquote>

                  'groen' one has a quite traditional flower on its right, but sports a somewhat fantastic bird on its

                <p>My wife and I acquired the very large (10” tall) pitcher shown in the left photo
                  above when we visited Delft in 1997.  Some 5 years later I got the larger of the two
                  pitchers shown here, which is from the same mold but with different decoration, and marked
                  for the “Biltmore Estate Collection, Genuine Delft”.  George Vanderbilt, grandson of
                  Cornelius, visited Ashville NC in 1888, found it ideal for his ‘country home’, and built
                  the 250 room Biltmore House (‘French Renaissance Chateau’) there between 1889 and 1895. 
                  These days the house and huge estate are a major tourist destination that in addition to
                  just letting folks gawk at the grounds and house has a luxury hotel, inn, and cottage, and
                  peddles wine, ‘professional development’ and equestrian activity…in addition to geegaws
                  like this Delft cow.  Its smaller neighbor (a mere 7 ½” tall) is a more recent
                  acquisition, and is marked “Delft ©Deco, Handpainted Holland”, under a sketch of windmill,
                  in an outline that looks to me sort of like a snowman. I do have another Delft-ish creamer
                  similarly marked, so perhaps it really is from Holland.</p>

                <p> For the rest of this page, I will be featuring Delft ware cow creamers made elsewhere - most of
                  them in Germany, and many of them from late 19c or early 20c. This lovely group of three large ones
                  is a good place to start - they are porcelain, realistically molded, and adorned with pictures of an
                  idyllic Dutch countryside - windmills, farm houses, birds and sailboats. They do not bear any maker's
                  or national marks, but their style and quality imply that they came from one of the high end German
                  porcelain factories, when quality cow creamers were popular. From the frequency in which they appear
                  on ebay this form seems to have been extremely well liked.</a>
