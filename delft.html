                        <p>From the website of De Delftse Pauw, <a href="http://www.delftsepauw.com/">http://www.delftsepauw.com/</a>,  we learn that 
                            : </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“In  the sixteenth century, in a number of Dutch towns, factories were established  which among their items produced &quot;Majolica&quot;. This  &quot;Majolica&quot; was made with a tin-glaze and found its origins in Italy and Spain. The  Dutch East Indian Company began importing porcelain from China in the  seventeenth century. This porcelain, especially the blue and white became very  popular. 
                                “The &quot;Majolica&quot;  producing factories started at a certain moment to imitate this Chinese  porcelain, because of several reasons. The imported Chinese porcelain meant  competition. Civil war in China  made that imports from China  went down. Customers asked for specific items which due to distance took a long  time to deliver and due to language problems the delivered item was not always  what was ordered. In Delft, in the seventeenth century 32  factories were producing Delftware. One of them was a factory called &quot;de  Paauw&quot;. These factories were often established in beerbreweries which had  stopped their production. In the nineteenth century due to competition from  other factories like Wedgewood in England and lack of innovations,  the highlight of Delftware had come to a close. Nowadays in Delft only a few companies still produce the  entirely handpainted traditional Delftware. One of these companies is &quot;de  Delftse Pauw&quot;. A company which is very loyal to this tradition.” </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The Delft City  website (<a href="http://www.delft.nl/">www.delft.nl</a>) features a number of  factories that produce the famous pottery; for example the Royal Delft factory,  Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles, dating from 1653, claims to be the only one that  has remained operational in the city since the 17c.  Their Royal Delft web site shows colorations  that range from the traditional blue to polychrome, pinjacker (red, blue and  gold decorations, based on Japanese Imari), and black.	  </p>

                                    <p>These two lovely   Delft creamers, one blue and   white and the other polychrome, are by different artists using Mold 795  of the   Oud Delft Company, which - from <a href="http://www.sephari.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span id="lw_1230832369_3">www.sephari.com</span></a> – we learn was founded by Roelof   Elshout in 1920, as an offshoot of the Potterie Rembrandt in   Nijmegen.  The factory passed   to his brother Hugo, then to Hugo’s daughter Cora in 1988.  In 1996 the company   was incorporated into Aardwerkfabirek’t  Delftshce Huys B.V., and moved to   Waddinxveen where it still manufactures earthenware products.  I don’t know the   age of these creamers, but they certainly date from before 1968 when the company   switched from the hand-painted mark (a stylized <span id="lw_1230832369_4">potters wheel</span>) to a printed version.  Oud   Delft is noted for using an   opaque white glaze with no tin or lead oxide, to mimic a tin-glazed look, over   the white biscuit of modern Delftware.</p></td>

                                    <p>Here is another Oud Delft creamer from the same ‘795’ mold, this one clearly marked
                                        for manufacture in May 1963. I’d like to know if they have made cow creamers from
                                        different molds, but have been unable to locate contact information for the company or its
                                        successor.</p></td>

                                    <p>This creamer is quite   similar to the two from Oud Delft.  It is certainly from a very similar mold,   but has a different, duller glaze(probably tin), and a much rougher texture to   the ceramic.  The base bears the initials AL, but the <span id="lw_1230832369_5">maker’s mark</span> is missing and appears   from scratch marks to have been scraped or chipped off.  Why someone would   deliberately obliterate it I don’t know…perhaps it was considered a ‘second’ and   the maker wanted to make sure it didn’t carry their mark?  If so, it isn’t clear   to me what the problem may have been.  The seller, from the   UK, marketed it as   Faience, probably Angouleme, @19c; since she sells   mostly Faience, and that term basically means tin-glazed earthenware, she could   well be correct.  I have included it here however because of its close   resemblance to the two that are definitely Delft.  Might it be that   Oud, a fairly modern company, borrowed or copied an earlier mold?  </p></td>

                                        <p>This is a lovely blue and white Dutch example from the late  19c.  I believe, from what the seller  said, that the marks attribute this creamer to the Gebr. (brothers) Tichelaar factory,  circa 1880-1895; currently named Tichelaars Koninklijke Makkumer Aardewerk-en Tegelfabriek  (Royal Tichelaar Makkum).  This  supposedly was the first mark that they used.   They have a neat website with an English version (start at <a href="http://www.tichelaar.nl/shop/ceramics.php">http://www.tichelaar.nl/shop/ceramics.php</a>)  , from which I learned that “On  a Spanish map from 1572, today’s location of Royal Tichelaar Makkum’s factory  is already marked ‘bricaria’: a brickyard. It is the oldest proof of the  company’s more than four centuries of uninterrupted ceramic history. By 1670,  domestic pottery had replaced bricks as core business and from 1890 Royal  Tichelaar Makkum concentrated on ornamental earthenware. The family company  owes its continuity up to the present day to its appreciation of tradition, though  with an eager eye for innovation.”  They  do have some cows on their web site shop, but none that are creamers…and given  the current prices for the new ones, the amount I paid for this old beauty  makes it a great bargain. </p>

                                        <p>Here’s a nice and unusual rendition  that I believe to be quite modern, and is at any rate different from many of my  other Delft  creamers – assuming, that is, that it really is Delft since many with that moniker refer more  to the style of decoration than the locale of manufacture.  It’s hard to know for sure (although it was  sols as vintage Delft),  since its only markings are “15” and “F” written in blue, and it cane to me  from exotic Arizona.  The three flowers with yellow centers on each side are a nice touch, as are the  bright red nostrils, small teats, and ‘lips’. Looks like it’s wearing lipstick.  It is nicely made, with a small lid that bears the tip of the tail.</p>

Just as the Delft potters mimicked the Chinese coloration when it became popular in the 17c, so many other factories -- e.g., in Germany, Japan and China -- have mimicked Delftware.  The creamer on the left in this picture, although not marked, is porcelain and has tiny pointy teats, and is almost certainly an older German creamer; the one on the right is signed for W.H.Sechler, about whom I can find no information.</p></td>

I do have another Delft-ish creamer similarly marked, so  perhaps it really is from Holland.</p></td>

Can’;t find them on the web…and since none of the terms are copyrighted, it’s as likely Chinese as Dutch.
