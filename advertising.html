          <h1>Advertising and Souvenirs</h1>

          <p>These two categories overlap quite a bit, so it made sense to me to display them together although there
            are some features that could be used to differentiate them.  At one end of the spectrum there are cow
            creamers that represent a cow or milk product or place.  The most famous of these (at least in the US) is
            Borden’s Elsie.  Other examples include the many cow creamers from places like Jersey or Guernsey that are
            famous for their eponymous breeds.   At the other end of the spectrum there are cow creamers that simply
            served as inexpensive remembrances of a place someone visited, e.g. Niagara Falls (No cows last time I
            visited – but they did have a variety of pigs. Tastes change I guess.). Then there are mixtures such as the
            plastic Whirley Moo-Cow creamers that were sold in the millions through restaurants and usually bore words
            or pictures, sometimes both, some with advertisements and some with sayings or place names.  Another type
            of overlap is found in the rather lovely porcelain creamers (mostly German and French) that date from
            Victorian days through about the 1930s.While these were usually bought as keepsakes of a pleasant holiday
            they also served to advertise the beauties of various cities and resorts. </p>
			
          <p><br>
            Let’s start this page with Elsie, who was created as a cartoon mascot to symbolize the quality of Borden’s
            products in 1936. She was an immediate hit, and Borden and their follow-on companies have stuck with her. 
            Following their popular exhibit at the New York World’s Fair in 1939, where they had several live cows,
            Borden decided to select one to satisfy children who wanted to know which one was the REAL Elsie.&nbsp; The
            one they picked from their herd was a Jersey originally named “You’ll Do Lobelia”, and she became a
            national favorite.&nbsp; Borden produced a number of creamers and pitchers of Elsie (along with many other
            advertising products) - as well as of her husband Elmer (of glue fame), who in the head-only versions
            accompanied her as a sugar bowl.&nbsp;While I have been unable to determine when Borden started making and
            selling these creamers, I suspect it was soon after the World’s Fair, say the very early 1940s.  As shown
            below, the ‘designer’ of the original full-body version applied for a patent in January 1943.  That patent
            didn’t seem to bother the imitators however, and ever since there have been innumerable ‘look-alikes’ or
            knock-off Elsies, some but not all of which bear a striking resemblance to the ‘official’ versions.</p>

                    except that he was a quite well known ‘cartoon’ artist, who in the 1920s and 30s produced images of
                    bears for Union Pacific, as well as some paintings that were rendered into woodcuts, and then into
                    cut glass, that hung in the Bear Pit Lounge and dining room of Yellowstone’s Old Faithful Inn. ..</p>

                <p>This pot-metal version of Elsie in the ‘official’ shape came from Borden’s exhibit at the “1947
                  Eastern State’s Exposition” in West Springfield, MA (the first after the end of WWII). I know that
                  for a fact because it’s impressed into her left side, below a script “Howdy”, a line that’s
                  indecipherable, and Elsie’s ‘signature’.  This poor Elsie is in very sad shape – she’s badly pitted,
                  cracked, and eroded, is missing part of her right horn, and on the way to me had three of her legs
                  broken off.  She was so badly damaged in shipping that the seller kindly refunded my purchase price,
                  but before dispatching her to her final pasture I managed to patch her up just well enough to take
                  this picture.  I’d really like to acquire a better version of this cow but because of the very low
                  quality of the post-war metal I expect that most of them, like this one, have fared poorly over the
                  years. At the very least I’d sure like to learn what the illegible line of script on her side says –
                  so if anyone out there has one that’s readable, please let me know.</p>

                    Pennsylvania. Although the connection to the product isn't quite so clear, folks do put milk on
                    Jell-O. Thus they got in the act with the creamer on the left, which is Sebastian Miniature catalog
                    #LC-13, one of the many figurines created by Preston Baston and his son Woody. Baston did a series
                    of miniatures for Jell-O from 1951-56, and at the end of that series designed this cow creamer for
                    the company.  Jell-O had a hundred thousand of them made in Japan and offered them for $1.00 and a
                    coupon from their advertisements.  They're considerably more pricey these days. <a href="http://www.sebastianworld.com">See

                    their farms as well as products, and a history section that tells us that they “began in 1992 with
                    a cooperative of small organic dairy farms in Wisconsin,” when “natural products industry veterans,
                    Mark Retzloff and Paul Repetto, embarked on a search for organic milk in order to make organic
                    dairy products available in the marketplace.”&nbsp; Given the growing interest in organic products,
                    these days they “proudly source organic milk from over 500 family farms and cooperatives across the
                    country, and that number is growing every day. We have contributed to converting hundreds or
                    thousands of acres to organic farmland. We continue to help hundreds of farmers throughout the
                    country transition to organic production to help provide more great tasting certified organic dairy
                    foods to our consumers.”&nbsp; This little plastic ad must be mighty proud!&nbsp; And Mark and Paul
                    must be doing very well. The ad for another of these creamers on eBay in late 2011 added that
                    Horizon Organic is owned by Dean Foods, and its products distributed by White Wave Foods.</p>

                <p>The base of this lovely cow reads “Though only a cow I feel quite proud for I bring you pure milk
                  from the Dairy of Frowd”.   A web search didn’t turn up any stories about a farm by this name, but I
                  did manage to find a late 19c picture of dairy men in front of the Charles F. Frowd dairy shop at 36
                  Western Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, at  <a href="http://www.1066online.co.uk/gallery/old-photos/36-western-road">http://www.1066online.co.uk/gallery/old-photos/36-western-road</a>. 
                  Interestingly, this creamer isn’t British-made, but rather is stamped on the bottom for Royal Dux, a
                  company in the town of Duchov in then Bohemia, now the Czech Republic.  Their wares are apparently
                  quite highly regarded and there are several articles on the web with information for Royal Dux
                  collectors.</p>

                <p>“Moo-Cow” creamers were all the rage in the 1970s.  They are all marked on the bottom for Whirley
                  Industries, Inc. of Warren PA.  I’ve had some fun digging a bit into their history, with the help of
                  one of their founders and some material that I was able to find on the web..  The company started
                  when two young men who were classmates at Dartmouth College (Class of 1954), one from Warren and the
                  other from New York City, got back together and decided to start a business in Warren in 1960. Their
                  first endeavor was building and repairing Laundromats (‘Whirley Wash’).  That went so well that they
                  hired professional help for the repair work, moved into becoming distributors, and then decided to
                  expand by selling coin operated car washes.  Then in the late 1960s they heard about some molds for
                  plastic salt and pepper shakers that hadn’t sold well and were available for sale near Boston.  That
                  got them started in the plastics business. After a fairly slow start a distributor came up with the
                  idea of putting samples on restaurant tables at no cost to the owners, and customers started buying
                  them.  They became very popular and opened up new markets for the company. Then they got a call from
                  another distributor friend who told them that the salt and pepper shakers were the best product he’d
                  seen since a ceramic cow creamer that he had sold. By that time the ‘Whirley’ boys were seriously
                  into the plastic molding business, so they turned to their chief engineer who designed the moo-cow
                  creamer, based on a ceramic one that they thought came from England (I believe the ceramic creamer
                  from which they took the idea was identical or at least similar to my own first cow creamer, and was
                  actually made in the US).  Following the successful pattern of the salt and pepper shakers, they
                  marketed them in the 1970s through restaurants and gift shops, with the further embellishment of
                  customized place or restaurant names and designs on the front panel.  Most were brown, some yellow,
                  some with white bottoms, and a few were purple.  At the suggestion of a customer they added a straw
                  hole in the back of the cow’s head.  They manufactured and sold over 10 million of them, which not
                  only made them a lot of money and firmly implanted them in the plastics business, but brought the
                  name Whirley a lot of recognition. As you can see from these pictures they added a (less successful)
                  syrup dispenser, and sold them as sets as well as through the restaurants. One of their historical
                  notes states that when interstate highways displaced the state highways in the ‘80s the business of
                  selling through restaurants deteriorated and they had to discontinue the cows and redesign their
                  product line.  Their next major idea was the original travel mug…and the success story went on from
                  there.  In 2004 they acquired a company called DrinkWorks! which had developed manufacturing
                  facilities in China…and today as Whirley-DrinkWorks! they remain  happily designing and delivering
                  food and beverage products from their headquarters that remains in Warren, PA.  And while they
                  haven’t made moo-cow creamers for the last couple decades, these plastic cows remain one of the more
                  readily available and popular items on eBay. </p>

                    Whirley is, however, far from the first to use a cow for a souvenir.  Here are two examples of
                    British Jackfield creamers (they have the place name on one side and the traditional gold markings
                    on the other), “A Present from Abertillery”, and “A Present from Teignmouth”.  I also have one from
                    Skegness, see the Jackfield theme…and who knows how many other British destinations also used the
                    popular cow creamer to lure tourists into a purchase. </p>
                  <p>These creamers, and a question from one of my cow-respondents, led me to wondering when and why
                    these souvenir cows became popular.  One clue comes from the locations where they were purchased –
                    e.g. in the case of these cows, Teignmouth is on the coast of Devon, Skegness on the coast in
                    Linclonshire, and Abertillery is very near the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales. A quick look
                    at many of the other souvenir creamers, especially the Pre-WW I ones from Britain, indicates that
                    they also hail from seaside or similar locations that became popular vacation spots in the
                    Victorian era (1837-1901).  A little googling quickly led me to some articles by Prof. John Walton
                    of the University of Central Lancashire that traced the history and popularity of the ‘British
                    Seaside Resort’…as well as to a July 2013 article in the Telegraph that discussed the propensity of
                    the Brit’s to bring home a souvenir to remind them of the pleasures of their vacations. The
                    burgeoning popularity of such vacations in the Victorian era can be attributed to a combination of
                    the social changes of the time and the rapid expansions of the British rail system, starting in the
                    1840s, that enabled the middle and working classes to afford transportation to the resorts.  The
                    introduction of bank holidays in 1871 further increased the opportunities for summer vacations, and
                    in turn the amenities of the seaside and other resorts expanded to help attract and expand the
                    working class holiday market in places like Blackpool and Southend.  Certainly cow creamers weren’t
                    the only vacation souvenirs - candy, posters, post cards, and a wide range of china with crests or
                    pictures of the resort were all very popular – but cow creamers were fashionable on their own in
                    those days, so they naturally became part of the souvenir trade.  And, as is evident from the
                    examples on this page of my web site, the Germans were quick to take advantage of this market,
                    especially before WW I but also in the between-war years in the 20s when, as discussed further
                    below,  their products bore the stamp ‘foreign’ to avoid the post-war British antipathy for German
                    products.</p>

                <p>Here is a great testimony to the connections between British seaside holidays and souvenirs

                  before, and was at one time the prized souvenir of someone who visited the “Promenade from Ross
                  Castle, Cleethorpes”.  Cleethorpes is on the coast in North Lincolnshire, and the visitoruk.com site
                  informs us that “Situated on Cleethorpes' promenade in the heart of the town, Ross Castle appears to
                  be the ruins of an ancient castle but it is in fact a Victorian folly, built in 1863. As Cleethorpes
                  was being developed as a holiday resort, following the arrival of the railways in the 19th-century,
                  the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincoln Railway Company built a mile long promenade here to prevent
                  continuing coastal erosion of the cliffs on which the town was sited. Above the promenade the rail
                  company decided to build the mock ruin as a visitor attraction and it was named Ross Castle after the
                  company's secretary Mr. Edward Ross.” </p>

                  Wikipedia we learn that the Isle of Man, which has been inhabited since before 6500 BCE, is
                  located in the middle of the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea" title="Irish Sea">Irish
                    Sea</a>.  It is a is a self-governing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_dependencies"
                    title="Crown dependencies">British Crown Dependency</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state"
                    title="Head of state">head of state</a> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II"
                    title="Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who holds the title of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_Mann"
                    title="Lord of Mann">Lord of Mann</a> and is represented there by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor"
                    title="Lieutenant Governor">Lieutenant Governor</a>.  The island’s foreign relations and
                  defence are the responsibility of the British Government. while its own parliament and government
                  have competence over all domestic matters. The island’s parliament, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tynwald"
                    title="Tynwald">Tynwald</a>, claims to be the oldest continuously existing ruling body in the
                  world. Second, this is the bull of Colman’s mustard, one of my favorites, as well apparently of
                  the Manx.  The ‘Colman’s of Norwich’ web site tells its story: Jeremiah Colman , a flour miller,
                  took over a mustard company based on the river Ytas, 4 miles south of Norwich, in 1814. His
                  business prospered, and in 1903 the company bought its rival mustard manufacturer, Keen &amp;
                  Son. In 1995 Colman’s was bought by Unilever who wisely has retained the name and its symbols.
                  The bull’s head was introduced in 1855 to symbolize tradition and quality…and I’m delighted to
                  welcome this one to my collection.</p>

                <p>The Staffordshire factories are in the souvenir game as well of course.  Here’s two that are
                  obviously from the same mold, and presumably the same maker.  The darker brown one is simply marked
                  for Clovelly, which is on the coast of North Devon.   I find from Hertiage Britain that “<span lang="EN">The

                    400' cliff along cobbled streets to the tiny working port and C14th quay.”  It’ll be a ‘must’ for
                    our next visit to the UK.  Of course, the right time to visit Devon has to be the second Tuesday in
                    September, which is when the Widecombe Fair – advertised on the light brown creamer – is held.  The
                    picture depicts  Uncle Tom Cobley and his friends riding to the fair on on a grey mare … from an
                    old Devon folk song which you can find at <a href="http://www.spreyton.org.uk/tom_cobley.htm"

                  <p>From the Victorian era (1837-1901) - when cow creamers were extremely popular – up until around up
                    until sometime after WWI, probably into the early 1930s, German porcelain makers produced some very
                    lovely souvenir cow creamers with quite detailed picture-transfers on their sides. This was a quite
                    expensive process, I’m told, and as shown further down this page the more modern souvenir cows bear
                    decals, paintings, writing, or some other less costly embellishment. These two cows serve as a good
                    example of the lovely German ones that now form such a large herd in my collection – some purchased
                    one at a time, and then an additional 35 or so acquired from the extensive collection of a Belgian
                    gentleman.  In addition to their quality, I like them because of the stories they have to tell
                    about the places in England and on the continent that they memorialize.  For example, here the
                    black and white cow is from Plauen, a city in Saxony that was founded by Polabian Slavs in the
                    12thC. The picture depicts Friedensbrücke, the world’s largest stone arch bridge (Wikipedia has
                    great write-ups about many German cities, and is the source for most of my brief descriptions). The
                    brown cow is from Baden-Baden in the western foothills of the Black Forest, famous for its baths
                    since Roman times.</p>

                <p>This seems to be a popular mold for these German transfer-picture cow creamers. This one showing the
                  Heidelberg Schloss (Castle) has an unusually large and well done picture.  The very nice write-up
                  about this castle in Wikipedia notes that “The earliest castle structure was built before 1214 and
                  later expanded into two castles circa 1294; however, in 1537, a lightning-bolt destroyed the upper
                  castle. The present structures had been expanded by 1650, before damage by later wars and fires. In
                  1764, another lightning-bolt caused a fire which destroyed some rebuilt sections.”  It has only been
                  partially rebuilt since, yet it became a popular tourist attraction early in the 19c and especially
                  after the railroad system reached Heidelberg in 1840.  Count Graimberg who was instrumental in its
                  preservation at the time popularized it with early pictures and souvenirs of which this cow – likely
                  from the late 19c – is an example.</p>

                <p>Here are two creamers from one of my favorite molds, which apparently also appealed to lots of
                  others since it has appeared in many variants (I think I must have at least a dozen), both with and
                  without the souvenir or advertising pictures.  The lighter brown cow depicts the main path or allee
                  in the important European Baroque Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen, one of the most famous sights in
                  Hanover (or Hannover) which is on the River Leive and is the capital and largest city of Germany’s
                  Lower Saxony.  The darker brown cow with the red ribbon brings ‘Greetings from Basel’, on the Rhine
                  River in northwestern Switzerland, near the borders of France and Germany and with suburbs in both of
                  those countries.  Basel is known today for its museums and university as well as its history of

                  two, the larger hails from Landau in der Pfalz which is in the wine region of southern
                  Rhineland-Palatine. This town was first settled in 1106, albeit the pictured Hauptbahnhof – railroad
                  station – dates from considerably later. The little one depicts St Mary’s Lighthouse<strong> </strong>which
                  (according to Wikipedia)  “is on the tiny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Island,_Tyne_and_Wear"
                    title="St Mary's Island, Tyne and Wear">St Mary's (or Bait) Island</a>, just north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Bay"

                  is submerged at high tide. The lighthouse and adjacent keepers' cottages were built in 1898 by the
                  John Miller company of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tynemouth" title="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a>,
                  using 645 blocks of stone and 750,000 bricks. It was built on the site of an 11th-century monastic
                  chapel, whose monks maintained a lantern on the tower to warn passing ships of the danger of the
                  rocks. The lamp was powered by paraffin, and was not electrified until 1977, St Mary's was by then
                  the last Trinity House lighthouse lit by oil.  The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1984.”  The cow
                  with the bell – one of my favorite molds and similar to one in the section above – comes from
                  Wurzburg which is in Franconia, Northern Bavaria, on the Main River. Among notable aspects of its
                  history were witch trials from 1626-1631, and a firebombing by the British in 1945. It has since seen
                  lots of restoration.</p>

                  from Wikipedia.  Most of them are souvenirs from cities in Belgium and Germany, but these seven all
                  are from the UK. From left to right, starting with the rear row (the brown cows), they picture
                  “Scarborough – South Bay”; “The North Bay Scarboro” (yes, same town on the North Sea Coast of North
                  Yorkshire, different spelling); and “The New Front – Southend-on-Sea”.  The middle row, again left to
                  right, brings us “A Present from Cambridge – St John’s College Bridge”; “A Present from Bournemouth –
                  West Beach Bournemouth”; and “Rough Sea at Brighton”.  I’ve been there in that kind of weather, and
                  it’s not at all pleasant!  And the little white cow in front advertises “West Promenade from Douglas
                  to M…”, so presumably it is from Douglas, the largest city and capital of the Isle of Man.</p>

                    “Triberg i.bad.Shwarzwald” which is in the Black Forest, and boasts a series of waterfalls on the
                    Gutach River that are among the tallest in Germany.  In the shot of three, on the left is a cow
                    from “Mergertheim Karlsbad”, in Wurtemburg in the valley of the Tauber, site of a magnificent
                    castle with archives of the Teutonic order, and residence of its Grand Master until its dissolution
                    in 1809. In the middle we find “Heidelberg von der Terasse”, on the river Neckar in SW Germany,
                    known for the Heidelberg Man. It escaped bombing in WWII because the allies wanted to us it as a
                    garrison base.  On the right is a cow from “Wildemann/Harz” in Lower Saxony, noted for its flora

                <p>The two in the left picture are from one of my favorite molds. They have some flaws from shipping,
                  but they are lovely nonetheless. On the left is a creamer from “Kur bad Lippspringe”, featuring a
                  health spa in this town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which was a Templar stronghold in the
                  13th century.  Its partner is from “Bad Nauheim, Tetchhaus”, a world-famous resort  in the Hesse
                  state of Germany, noted for its salt springs and ‘effervescent’ bath used to treat heart and nerve
                  diseases. In the right hand photo we first find a souvenir of “Das National Denkmal, Auf Den
                  Niederwald” which is also in the Hesse state.  The monument was built in the 1870/80s to commemorate
                  the unification of Germany; Kaiser Wilhelm I laid the first stone on September 16, 1871.  To the

                  “Andebken a.d. Drachenhohle B/Plauen l/v.c.” over “Walhalla”, basically a souvenir of the Dragenhole
                  in Plauen, a town in the Free State of Saxony . Walhalla is a hall of fame honoring distinguished
                  people in German history, above the Danube east of Regensburg in Bavaria.  The fourth cow in this
                  section is our first from Belgium, showing “Blankenberghe Grand Hotel” located in this North Sea
                  coastal town that is noted for its long beach, promenade, pier, busy marina, and art nouveau

                <p>Here are four creamers from Belgian cities.  The two nearly identical ones in the left photo are
                  both from La Panne, on the North Sea coast of the Belgian province of West Flanders.  The Belgian
                  royal family lived here during WWI because it’s in the tiny fraction of the country that wasn’t
                  conquered by the Germans.  The cow on the left sports “La Digue, Les Villas Royales”, and its mate
                  features “La Digue et la Plage”.  Apparently the Dike is a prominent and popular feature.  In the
                  right photo, the cow with black hooves is a souvenir of “Rallye Vielsalm, La Meute”  For those who
                  are stuck with just English, it depicts ‘the pack’ at a fox hunt in Vielsalm, a Walloon municipality
                  of Belgium in the province of Luxembourg.  Its colleague advertises “Valee de la Warche, Le Pont de
                  Outre  - Le Pont a Malmedy” The Warche is a river in the eastern Belgian province of Liege, which
                  flows through the village of Malmedy, site of a massacre of American POWs by Nazi SS troops during
                  the Battle of the Bulge.</p>

                  picture of “Geneve et le Mont Blanc” is quite obviously from Switzerland.  Her bilingual
                  (Dutch/French) companion states “Antwerpen Anvers, De Hoofdkerk, La Cathedral” and comes from the
                  capital of the Antwerp province of Flanders Belgium, the 2nd largest port in Europe.  The grey and
                  black cow displays the “Rathaus Breslau”, formerly in Lower Silesia of Germany and now known as
                  Wroclaw, Poland.   The reddish-brown cow bears “Barackenlager” beneath the picture of the barracks,
                  and “Gruss von  Fruppen-Ubungsplatz Elsenborn” on its belly, basically Greetings from the training
                  camp in Elsenborn, Belgium. This town is noted for the Battle of Elsenborn Ridge in the Ardennes
                  Forest, the only sector of American front lines in the Battle of the Bulge where the Germans failed

                <p>To complete the roster of the German cows from the Belgian collection, we start with one more from
                  England, the second of my souvenirs from Cleethorpes showing the Promenade from Ross Castle, the mock
                  ruin built in 1863 by the railway as a tourist attraction, and named after its then president.  The
                  little grey and black cow with the bell pictures “Dinant – Fort, Citadelle et Eglise”. Dinant is a
                  Walloon city on the River Meuse in Belgium, and the 11c Citadel and Gothic 13c Collegiate Church of
                  Notre Dame de Dimant are its major sights.,  And last but by no means least, another cow from one of
                  my favorite molds, is from ”Montaigu, La Basilique Façade, Scherpenheuvel, de Basiliek, Voorgevel”.
                  This ‘sharp hill’ is the most important Roman Catholic pilgrimage site in Belgium, located some 50 km
                  east of Brussels.  Wikipedia tells us that its origins date back to the pagan worship that still
                  survived during the Middle-Ages around a holy oak on the hilltop, The cross-shaped tree was
                  ‘Christianized’ with a statue of the Holy Mary.</p>

                <p>These beautifully crafted cows bear at least a family resemblance to the German crested
                  transfer-picture creamers.&nbsp; In this case however, we know that they’re French from the
                  ‘Porcelaine de France’ stamp (can’t identify the mark) on the hoof of the larger cow.  It bears a
                  picture of  “Le Treport – avant port &amp; Eglise”.&nbsp; I bought it on eBay from a group called
                  Plucky Maidens of Portland, Oregon. Among other things they lead shopping tours to the flea markets
                  of Paris. They said that this cow came from the Porte de Vanves ‘marche aux puces’ in the 14th
                  arondissement (weekends only, and it can be reached on line 13 of the Paris Metro should you care to
                  visit&nbsp; - it’s purportedly one of Paris’s best). Wikipedia informs us that Le Treport is “a small

                    target="_blank" title="Seaside resort">sea-side resort</a> and home to a casino.” They also note
                  that it was the location for the “2014 French police thriller <em>Witnesses (Les Tremoins).</em>”&nbsp;
                  .  The similar but smaller cow here has a black stamp on the belly with the same maker’s mark as well
                  as “Made in France”, and its picture is of nesting storks.  It was also an eBay purchase, but without
                  the pleasure of an interesting story since it came from the un-exotic city of Houston TX.  My wife
                  and I haven’t seen nesting storks in France, but we have spent quite some time watching them in
                  places like Hungary, Estonia, and Uzbekistan.</p>

                  to me via the ‘catawiki.com’ auction site from the extensive collection of the Belgian gentleman from
                  whom I also got a large herd of German transfer creamers. <br>
                  All of these bear the ‘Porcelaine de France’ symbol shown above, some on the hoof, some on the belly.
                  The cow on the left hails from ‘the little port’: “Le Portel – la plage, vue des falaises”, according
                  to Wikipedia ‘a tourist, fishing and light industrial town about 2 miles southwest of Boulogne. It
                  has a beach and the white cliffs of the English coast can be seen across the sea on clear days. The
                  original Le Portel was a hamlet east of Outreau. It became an independent municipality on June 13,
                  1856 by an imperial decree of Napoleon III. In the 19th century, flint tools were discovered in the
                  centre of the village, by the river near the Hamel Bridge, evidence of the long occupation of the
                  site.’  The middle cow displays “Malo – les bains, la plage” which I assume is the famous
                  past-privateering center and now tourist destination of Saint Malo, a walled port city in Brittany in
                  northwestern France on the English Channel. The cow on the right shows “Dieppe – Vue generale prise
                  de l’eglise St Jacques”. Dieppe  is a coastal community  in the Normandy region of northern France, a
                  port on the English Channel, at the mouth of the Arques river, famous for its scallops and with a
                  regular ferry service to Newhaven in England.  Dieppe  has a popular pebbled beach, a 15th-century
                  castle and the churches of Saint-Jacques and Saint-Remi. </p>

                <p>The cow on the left simply bears a picture of a sailboat. The one on the right has “Lille – la
                  bourse et le theatre”. Lille is in French Flanders, on the Deûle River, near the border with
                  Belgium.  Wikipedia states that “the legend of &quot;Lydéric and Phinaert&quot; puts the foundation
                  of the city of Lille at 640. Lille's Dutch name is Rijsel, which comes from ter ijsel (at the
                  island). The French name has the same meaning and comes from l'île (the island).”  The cute little
                  mustard, salt &amp; pepper boat – which came with the cows – features “Nice – La Promenade des
                  Anglais”.  Our Wikipedia source explains that “Starting in the second half of the 18th century, the
                  English aristocracy took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. In
                  1820, when a particularly harsh winter up north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, some of the
                  English proposed a useful project for them: the construction of a walkway (chemin de promenade) along
                  the sea. It was paid for by the Rev. Lewis Way. The city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a
                  pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the Camin
                  deis Anglés (the English Way) by the Niçois in their native dialect Nissart. After the annexation of
                  Nice by France in 1860 it was rechristened La Promenade des Anglais.”</p>

                  <p>These five are from the second batch of French porcelain cow creamers that I got from a Belgian
                    gentleman’s collection via the Catawiki auction site.  From left to right they represent cities as
                    follows, information courtesy of Wikipedia:  Honfleur is in northwestern France, across from Le
                    Havre on the southern bank of the Seine estuary. This cow displays the 18c Lieutenancy building
                    which is at the entrance to the old harbour, initially home to the Lieutenant of the king, later
                    the commerce tribunal, then the local governor.  Next is a cow from Domrémy in northeastern France,
                    now called Domrémy-la-pucelle in honor of the Virgin of Orleans, Joan of Arc, whose birthplace home
                    is pictured.  This cow (I assume it’s a heifer) must be very proud to be so honored.  In the second
                    picture, on the left is a cow from the old city of Metz which is in northeast France near the
                    junction with Germany and Luxembourg. It has variously been “a Celtic oppidum, an important
                    Gallo-Roman city, the Merovingian capital of the Austrasia kingdom, the birthplace of the
                    Carolingian dynasty, a cradle of the Gregorian chant, and one of the oldest republics in Europe.
                    The city has been steeped in Romance culture, but has been strongly influenced by Germanic culture
                    due to its location and history.” Pictured is the fortified city gate ‘Door of the Germans’ which
                    formerly served as a bridge over the river Seille.  The next cow bears the UNESCO World Heritage
                    commune of Mont Ste Michelle, located just off the coast of Normandy.  My wife and I have been
                    among its 3 million plus visitors per year. Last in this group is a cow honoring the lake at
                    Gererdmer, now a ski resort in northeast France near the German border. </p>

                  hails from Nancy in northeast France, formerly the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. Pictured on both
                  cows is Place Stanislaus, built in the mid 18c by Stanislaus I of Poland to connect the medieval old
                  town with the ‘new town’ built by Charles III in the 17c.  These days it’s a World Heritage Site.</p>

                  so on the right flank in gold) made in this very popular but expensive photo-transfer fashion. Here
                  the picture is of the castle of Mont Orgueil, constructed (per the Wikipedia article) following the
                  division of the Duchy of Normandy in 1204, and defending the harbor of Gorey on the east side of the
                  island. The castle lost its warfighting utility after gunpowder came into regular use, since there is
                  a nearby somewhat higher hill from which it could be easily bombarded.  It was then used as a prison
                  until the end of the 17c, then became run down until it was fixed up for garrison accommodation and
                  other military and ceremonial uses. It became a museum in the 20c.</p>

                  elesewhere, this creamer would appear to be a ‘summer souvenir’ for the working class folks who
                  flocked to the seaside early in the 20c and then again between the wars.  It’s a lovely little cow.</p>

                <p>Here are two versions of an interesting variant – both German made after WWI, as evidenced by the
                  “foreign” stamp.  As noted elsewhere, this was used during the post-war period when the Brits were
                  very keen on acquiring crested or otherwise marked souvenir china, but were reluctant to buy anything
                  recognizably German.  The creamer with the picture of 3 ladies reads “Welsh Costumes”, and has “RHSL”
                  on the other side; I have no idea what that may mean.  The other creamer bears the coat of arms of
                  Edinburgh…thus here we have a cow that seems to have been popular in both Wales and Scotland.  For
                  those of you with an interest in the arcane, here’s a description of the coat of arms:<br>
                  “The shield is blazoned as &quot;Argent, a castle triple-towered and embattled Sable, masoned of the
                  First and topped with three fans Gules, windows and portcullis shut of the Last, situate on a rock
                  Proper.&quot; In other words - the shield is silver or white, and the castle is black stonework with
                  white joints. It must be shown with three towers each surmounted by a red flag and must have two or
                  more windows and an entrance coloured red, with a portcullis shown lowered. It stands upon a rock of
                  stony colours. (The castle has long been a symbol for Edinburgh, the Castle Rock having been
                  fortified since Neolithic times.) Above the shield is a coronet, appropriate to the statutory Council
                  of a city. The crest probably derives from the office of Admiral of the Forth, held by the Lord
                  Provost - &quot;an anchor tethered about with a cable all Proper (that is, in natural colours) set of
                  a wreath of the colours.&quot; This wreath or torse represents cloth coloured in the city’s livery,
                  silver on one side and black on the other and twisted so as to show three twists of each colour.
                  Above the anchor is the motto ‘NISI DOMINUS FRUSTRA’ associated with Edinburgh since 1647. The
                  interpretation is ‘Except the Lord in Vain’ and is a normal heraldic contraction of a verse from the
                  127th Psalm. Two figures or ‘supporters’ flank the shield. On the ‘dexter’ (the viewer’s left) is the
                  figure of a young woman with long hair and richly dressed. On the ‘sinister’ (the viewer’s right)
                  stand a doe. <br>

                <p>This is another British souvenir cow from a similar mold, again bearing the Foreign stamp to
                  disguise its German origin – from Exmouth in this case.  It has a sprig of ‘lucky white heather’ on
                  its left side – a very popular crest on souvenir items.  I have found several explanations of why
                  white heather is considered lucky. For example, we learn from <a href="http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/mythfolk/heather.html">http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/mythfolk/heather.html</a>:
                  that “The idea that white heather is lucky was popularised by the Victorians and their love of
                  Scottish traditions. In 1884 Queen Victoria herself wrote about her servant Mr Brown, who
                  &quot;espied a piece of white heather, and jumped off to pick it. No Highlander would pass by it
                  without picking it, for it was considered to bring good luck.&quot; White heather's luck may have
                  been attributed to it because of its scarcity, in the same way that four-leaf clovers brought other
                  Celts luck. Other interpretations include the more romantic notion that white heather grows over the
                  final resting places of faeries, or the idea that in a country of many ancient battles, white heather
                  grew on patches of ground where no blood had been shed. Indeed white heather's luck appears
                  originally to have been associated mainly with battles; in 1544 Clan Ranald attributed a victory to
                  the fact they had worn white heather in their bonnets, and Cluny of Clan MacPherson attributed his
                  escape after Culloden to the fact that searchers had overlooked him whilst he slept on a patch of
                  white heather.”  On an even more romantic note, I found a couple sites, including Yahoo answers,
                   that tell the following tale: “Long, long ago in Scotland, the famous Celtic bard, Ossian, had a
                  daughter called Malvina. She was beautiful and sweet natured. She won the heart of Oscar, a handsome
                  warrior. They became betrothed, but Oscar left in search of fame and fortune. Malvina pined for him
                  and sought solace by telling her father how much she loved her brave warrior, Oscar.  On a beautiful
                  autumn day, the two were sitting on a Highland hillside when a ragged messenger staggered towards
                  them. He brought the terrible news that Oscar had been killed in a mighty battle. The messenger held
                  out a spray of purple heather to Malvina - a last gift from Oscar - and told her that he had died
                  whispering her name and pledging his love. In her grief, Malvina ran over the hillside, weeping
                  bitterly. Where her tears fell, the purple heather turned pure white. When she saw this, she said
                  &quot;May this white heather forever bring good fortune to all those who find it&quot;. And so, in
                  Scotland, to this very day, white heather continues to be a token of good luck.”  This is much, much
                  more than you wanted to know, I’m sure…but isn’t it interesting the tales that cows have to tell?</p>

                <p>This creamer – from the same mold as the two above from Bournemouth and Brighton, also bears (as do
                  they) the ‘foreign’ stamp.  I find it sort of ironic that although the British public may have been
                  reluctant to purchase items that were obviously made in Germany, the peddlers were by no means shy
                  about using German imports as souvenirs for some of their most beloved places…here, Windsor.</p>

                  www.villagenet.co.uk/collectors/crestedchina.html we learn that “Collecting heraldic porcelain
                  miniatures, or crested china as it is now popularly known, became a national craze in the late
                  Victorian and Edwardian eras. During the period of its production, around 1880 to1930, it is thought
                  that around 90% of all homes contained some pieces.&nbsp; Indeed, no holiday or seaside outing was
                  complete without the purchase of some piece of souvenir porcelain. The introduction of Bank holidays
                  in 1871, paid holidays for workers and improved wages, combined with improved travel facilities such
                  as trains, paddlesteamers and charabancs, boosted the sales of souvenirs considerably.”&nbsp;
                  Apparently the first pottery firm to come up with the ‘crest’ idea was W.H. Goss of Stoke-on-Trent,
                  and they initiated a national craze.&nbsp; Cheaper products from Germany, Austria etc soon flooded
                  the market, pushing out the more costly British china.  </p>

                <p>Here are examples of British and ‘foreign’ crested ware as mentioned above.  The Jersey cow is
                  marked “Grosvenor Ware”, and the City of York creamer is stamped with the crown &amp; shield of
                   Gemma . They tell an interesting (to me) story.  From The Potteries web site we learn that Grosvenor
                  Ware is a trade name for crested china made by Sampson Hancock &amp; Sons, earthenware manufacturers
                  at Tunstall 1857-70, then at other works in Stoke and then Hanley. “The company was founded by
                  Sampson Hancock, a prominent Wesleyan, in 1857 and was renamed S. Hancock &amp; Sons (Potters) Ltd.
                  in 1935. It closed in 1937, having been put into receivership on 23rd March. It was a relatively
                  small enterprise, employing around 150 people. Sampson Hancock died on 9th May 1900 and was succeeded
                  in the business by his sons, Jabez, Harry and Arthur.&nbsp; The company produced tablewares and
                  fancies for the popular market - its main income being from semi-porcelain and earthenware
                  tablewares, toilet wares, vases and vitreous hotel wares. Many of the products, including ironstone
                  china, were for export markets. After WW1 the company increased its production of ornamental and
                  decorative wares. These included children's wares and doll's heads. Boxed teasets for children were
                  being produced by 1917 featuring popular nursery rhymes and pictures of children. The company also
                  produced a range of crested wares, these being marked with the trade name <em>The</em> '<em>Duchess'
                    China </em>or <em>The 'Corona' China</em> and <em>Grosvenor Ware. </em>These may have been produced
                  in quantity to see the company through the war years when skilled labour was unavailable.Pieces
                  included animals, small decorative dishes and Great War commemoratives, or had English or Welsh
                  crests. Crested ware appears to have been made until the 1920s.”    I had trouble learning anything
                  about Gemma until I came across another collector’s very interesting and informative website, for
                  match strikers of all things!  (<a href="http://www.matchstrikergallery.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/index.html">http://www.matchstrikergallery.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/index.html</a>)
                  There I learned that Gemma crested ware comes from “Victoria” Schmidt &amp; Co. “This Czechoslovakian
                  porcelain factory was founded&nbsp;by Lazarus and Rosenfeld in 1883. They then sold the business to
                  Franz Schmidt in 1885. It lost it's independence in 1945 when it merged with two other firms,
                  Altrohlau Porcelain and EPIAG to become a part of Starorolský Porcelán. Then in 1958 it became part
                  of Karlovarský Porcelán Stará&nbsp;. Since around 1970 the factory has been used as a training
                  facility. Outside of it's home territory it is most well known for the Gemma crested ware range,
                  although a variety of other wares were also produced. The Crown and Shield mark … was used between
                  1918 and 1945.”  In addition to the history of these two companies, what makes this interesting is
                  that although both creamers seem to be from identical or very similar molds, the Czech-made creamer
                  is much more detailed and of higher quality (if indeed cheaper)  than the Brtitish one.  It may well
                  be that the Jersey cow dates from the ‘war years’ (WW I that is) as discussed above. <br>

                  China, 317, Model of Early Staffordshire Cow Cream Jug”.&nbsp; So apparently there were several
                  potteries with copies of this mold. From Wikipedia we learn that “Shelley Potteries, situated in
                  Staffordshire, was earlier known as Wileman &amp; Co. which had also traded as The Foley Potteries.
                  The first Shelley to join the company was Joseph Ball Shelley in 1862 and in 1896 his son <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Shelley_%28potter%29"
                    target="_blank" title="Percy Shelley (potter)">Percy Shelley</a> became the sole proprietor, after
                  which it remained a Shelley family business until 1966 when it was taken over by Allied English
                  Potteries. Its china and earthenware products were many and varied although the major output was
                  table ware. …Shelley is probably best known for its fine bone china “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco"
                    target="_blank" title="Art Deco">Art Deco</a>” ware of the inter-war years and post-war fashionable
                  tea ware.”&nbsp; There are Shelly collectors’ clubs in both the UK and US. Howver to me, the most
                  intriguing point here is the indication that there was a much earlier version of this ‘jug’ – so now
                  I have to keep looking! </p>

                  can’t pass up.  So, here’s yet one more Gemma creamer, this time not from the UK at all but rather
                  advertising “Umgungunhlovu, Pietmartinzburg”. As you can imagine this sent me to the atlas, then to
                  Wikipedia where I learned that “Pietermaritzburg is the capital and second largest city in the
                  province of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal" title="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>,
                  South Africa. It was founded in 1838, and is currently governed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msunduzi_Local_Municipality"
                    title="Msunduzi Local Municipality">Msunduzi Local Municipality</a>. Its &quot;purist&quot; Zulu

                    title="Umgungundlovu District Municipality">district municipality</a>.”  I can’t explain why the
                  cow has an ‘h’ instead of a ‘d’, but it does… Now, while the folks down there do indeed have cows, I
                  have a strong suspicion that this souvenir was designed to catch the eye of a British tourist (or
                  expat? Or Canadian, since it came to me from there). Whatever…as I’ve mentioned elsewhere, one of the
                  fun aspects of my collection is that you can’t help but learn new things from cows. </p>

                <p>While most of the early souvenir creamers were from German or English potteries, other factories
                  took advantage of their popularity.  Here are four from Luxembourg, which I acquired from the large
                  and lovely collection of a Belgian gentleman.  He had more examples, but I decided that these four
                  would be adequate for me..  The larger ones with their heads raised are both bottom-marked for
                  “Villeroy &amp; Boch”  (as well as “Made in Luxembourg”) which per its web site has had a proud
                  tradition of “elegance, innovative design and exceptional quality” since 1748.  These two aren’t
                  quite that old, but like others of this genre are likely late 19c or very early 20c.  One bears a
                  transfer picture of their home town, and the other displays the shield of Clervaux, a town and
                  commune in northern Luxembourg.  I assume that the monks bearing the shield are from the nearby Abbey
                  of St Maurice &amp; St Maur.  Villeroy &amp;Boch have fashioned a more modern cow creamer (in  Modern
                  Variations), but as of this posting none are shown on their web site.  Of the two more recumbent
                  cows, one has a picture of Pont Adolphe in Luxembourg and the other simply “SPA” which I expect in
                  this case refers to the name of the town in Belgium from which the generic term for a curative
                  mineral spring was derived.  The former bears a circular stamp with inside wording that reads “Made
                  in Luxembourg” around “A.L.” while the SPA cow is unmarked but obviously from the same mold. There is
                  a more modern cow of theirs, along with more information about V&B (now villeroyboch-group) near the
                  bottom of the Favortie Brands page.</p>

                <p>The more modern (here post-WWII) creamers remained popular as souvenirs but the pictures and crests
                  are quite a bit less refined, and much cheaper to produce than those with the earlier transfer
                  process. These six are all from the same mold – and all, I believe, are manufactured by Goebel,
                  although only the ones from Cham and Tegernsee (both have bells) are marked for them…with the TMK-3
                  small stylized V-bee, used from 1960-1972. The other four are simply marked in blue (as are the Cham
                  and Tegernsee cows) “Made in W. Germany”. Part of the fun of these is learning a bit about the towns
                  they depict, largely via Wikipedia: Hartberg is a small town in Styria, Austria; it was first
                  referred to as a ‘civitas’ in 1286, but settlements there date back to 3c BC, and presumably the
                  tower visible on the hill is one of the remnants of that early fortification. Monks founded a church
                  in the Bavarian forest near Cham (pronounced Kam) in the 8c, and the town itself has borne this name
                  since late 10c. Wiesbaden is an old spa town on the north bank of the Rhine in Saxony, continuously
                  occupied since the Romans build a fort there in 6AD. The creamer’s picture depicts the neo-classical
                  spa-house, built at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm from 1904-07. Butzbach is in Hesse, Germany, and
                  housed many US Army troops until they pulled out after the end of the Cold War. Tegernsee is a spa
                  town in Bavaria, about 50 miles south of Munich, on the lake of the same name. It’s Benedictine abbey
                  was founded in 746, and secularized in 1803 at which time it became the summer home of the Bavarian
                  royal family, the Wittlsbachs.</p>

                    The English king sent an army via Flanders to capture
                    Dunkerque as key invasion port to rid the country of revolutionaries. They
                    were joined by troops from Hanover and Austrians from neighboring Austrian
                    Flanders. 40,000 Frenchmen defeated 24,000 British and Hanoverian soldiers,
                    capturing 6 flags and all of the Duke of York's artillery. This strategic
                    victory resulted in the British lifting the siege of Dunkirk. Despite his
                    triumphant entry into the city, General Houchard was later tried and
                    guillotined for failing to pursue the British."  Really sweet guys, those

                  Once an important medieval trade center, in addition to remaining an important rail and river
                  junction it’s now known for it’s annual artist and clown festival. The picture shows its famous 15c

                <p>Here’s an interesting German contrast to the two Austrian cows’ souvenir pictures - a creamer
                  advertising Bad Windsheim, which is an even older (~741) small historic town in Bavaria, now known
                  mostly for its waters, spa, and an open air museum. Why would such a lovely old town choose to show
                  off such an ugly modern building? There’s another conundrum here as well: this creamer appears to be
                  from the same mold as the Goebel creamer shown here with it; but it’s unmarked, and bears the black
                  and gold sticker of E&amp;A Böckling, Neudenau, which is in Baden Württemberg. But…the Marchenhein
                  Goebel-marked souvenir creamer here bears both the Goebel mark and the E&amp;A Böckling sticker. I
                  can’t find anything about E&amp;A Böckling on the web; an anyone tell me about them or the
                  relationship, if any, between them and Goebel? <br>

                <p>With the exception of the little cow with the oversized head on the far left, these are also all
                  celebrating somewhere in the US. The little one with the oversized head – which probably should be
                  placed elsewhere – is a bit of a strange combination:  a Polish cow, marked for Sienna which is a
                  very popular medieval town and UNESCO World Heritage site in Tuscany, Italy. Why would Italians
                  choose to advertise with a Polish cow??  Next to it is one of those awful ‘cute’ cows (more of them
                  in the Modern Variations page) with an emblem that bears horses and ‘Villa Roma Resort Hotel’, which
                  is a family resort in Callicoon, N.Y.   Why would someone put pictures of horses on a cow?? The black
                  and white one with a pink nose in that picture is simply marked for Wisconsin.  The blue and white
                  ones in the other picture are from Hershey Park, PA, and Kentucky. The Kentucky cow features horses
                  along its side (ok, maybe that makes at least some sense).  The head in the middle is marked for
                  Harbor Springs, which is a small resort community on Little Traverse Bay on NW Lake Michigan.  It’s
                  unusual in that it’s a Royal Bayreuth piece – the only one of theirs I’ve ever seen used as a
                  souvenir. Generally these are too expensive for the tourist trade, so it may be that it was marked by
                  a previous owner.  The other unusual thing about it was its price – less than $10 to me, whereas
                  these lovely Royal Bayreuth creamers typically sell for many times that.  You can learn more about
                  them on the Heads and Favorite Brands pages.</p>

                <p>This is a beautiful classic German creamer that proudly bears the gilded name of “Johnson’s
                  Pasteurized Milk”  While some form of purifying milk has been around for centuries, the
                  ‘pasteurization’ process was developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864 and became commercialized around the
                  late 19c and early 20c.  The debate about the relative merits (and dangers) of raw and pasteurized
                  milk rages on, but the US Public Health Service developed what’s now called the ‘Pasteurized Milk
                  Ordnance” in 1924, as a basic standard for the states to adopt as a way of preventing milk borne
                  disease.   My guess therefore is that Mr Johnson chose to tout the cleanliness and healthiness of his
                  product sometime after that, but well before WWII, which would match pretty well with the period in
                  which cow creamers like this were being produced.   </p>

                  <p>Not to be surpassed is the popular tourist attraction of Niagara Falls.  Souvenir creamers from
                    there seem to fall into two categories.  Fairly early ones – say prior to WWII – are generally high
                    quality ceramic or porcelain, and bear a nice circular transfer print of the falls.  Of the three
                    shown here, the two brown and white ones are large V-Bee Goebels (the more realistic one bears the
                    mold mark S465) and the larger creamer in the back, white with colorful decorations,  is also
                    German porcelain and bears a “3672, I” imprint.  More recent cow souvenirs from the falls – four
                    are shown - appear to be less expensive, generally Japanese ceramic, with a rather crude painting
                    of the falls on their left side.   I have to assume that as souvenir cow creamers became less
                    popular, visitors were less willing to pay the higher prices that the quality ones would have
                    commanded.  My wife and I visited the Canadian side of the falls in summer ’07 (finally, after 45
                    years of marriage) in the hopes of encountering  some new versions, but there wasn’t a cow to be
                    found. Pigs yes…cows no. Tastes do change, and not always for the better.<br>

                  seller who indicated that it was most likely from the one in Quebec, because it came from the estate
                  of an elderly lady who lived in Buffalo NY.  With that hint, I found via Wikipedia that although it’s
                  a relatively small city, population just above 30 thousand, Saint-Georges is often considered the
                  Metropolis of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauce,_Quebec" title="Beauce, Quebec">Beauce
                    Region</a> of Quebec province because it's the largest city in the area. Its history dates to the
                  late 1700s, and today it is an important manufacturing centre, including textiles, steel forgings,
                  garage doors, bicycles and truck trailers, and it also boasts a number of stores and services not
                  found elsewhere in the region.  And apparently it is large enough to sport a souverir or two. </p>

                    <p>Jumping back across the Atlantic, this very modern little creamer is one of my few Irish
                      souvenirs – interestingly marked, although only with a yellow and green paper label, “A Present
                      from the Ronald Reagan, Ballyporeen”. I couldn’t pass it up. The seller noted that this pub is
                      now gone, the interior having been moved to the Ronald Reagan Library in California. I have
                      visited this library and it's lovely, but I don't recall the pub.</p>

                  associated with Kobe, not Hokkaido.  And while this little guy isn’t really a creamer,  more a little
                  pitcher or mug of sorts, he was cute (and cheap) enough that I couldn’t pass him up, especially
                  because he’s my only souvenir cow from anywhere in Asia.  </p>
