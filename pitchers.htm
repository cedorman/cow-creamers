            ‘bull’s blood’ perhaps (albeit that famous dark red wine – Egri Bikaver – is from
            Hungary, so maybe not since the pitcher hails from Portugal.)  It bears a seal from
            Boidallo Pinheiro, Est 1884.  They have an excellent web site (Google will translate it)
            which tells us that “Raphael Bordallo Pinheiro is one of the most influential people of
            nineteenth century Portuguese culture, with a remarkable production in relation to the
            areas of humoristic drawing, caricature and ceramic creation. His work represents an
            unsettling, timely reality and a fundamental document for political, social, cultural
            and ideological study of a time period…In 1884 Bordallo began his ceramics production at
            the Fábrica de Faianças in Caldas, revealing pieces of great technical, artistic and
            creative quality, developing tiles, panels, pots, table centerpieces, vase busts,
            fountain basins, pitchers, plates, perfume bottles, vases and gigantic animals, etc.” as
            well as a lot more.

From a number of web sources we learn that Animals &amp; Co  was well known for their cookie jars, teapots, and other whimsical pieces. The  trademark was federally registered on 7/23/84 in Santa    Fe, N.M., and then  the owners – Allen Walker and wife Jenny Lind - closed it down after a few  years.  Jenny did the design work while  Allen worked on the mold design.  As of  late 2016 they are still in Santa Fe,  producing primarily dinnerware under the company name of Rainbow Gate,  established in 1994.<strong></strong></p></td>

            <p>Here are four variations on the  ‘begging’ theme, from different ends of the earth.  The pitcher on the left, while unmarked, I  believe is from Japan  like the one with pinwheels.  The one  next to it, with the purple nose and brown bell, is incised for “Caldas de Raihna, Portugal”. Next to it, in black and  white, is one from a paint-it yourself ceramic shop, marked “For Mom, love Tom  and Cindy”.  The mottled brown one on the  right would appear to be from a similar mold, but the ad on eBay stated that  the seller bought it from a “’gentlemen’s private collection’, being sold  because of his divorce, which was mostly top quality glass and pottery; he  claimed it was English, c 1860-1880.”   The glaze does seem not unusual for that period, though I have no way of  knowing for sure.  True or not, I fell  for it.</p>            </td>

Actually it is Portuguese, clearly marked for Fabrica Sant’Anna, one of the oldest  traditional, high-end Lisbon  ceramic factories, established in 1741 and deriving its name from its original  location.

Apparently Vandor has an affinity for skinny legs.  www.vandorproducts.com  notes that they’re proud of “making retro cool since 1957…suppliers of hip and functional products”.  They create and distribute over 150 designs per year, and are based in Salt Lake City with offices in Hong Kong, China, and the Philippines.

            <p>As the mark here clearly shows, these three rather fierce  looking cows come from the Pearl China Company. The ‘Pearl  China  and Pottery Company’ was established by Dennis and George Singer in 1931, in East Liverpool, Ohio.  This city is sometimes known as the ‘Pottery  Capitol of the Nation’, and its Museum   of Ceramics lists dozens  of pottery companies that operated there. Pearl Co. was designed to serve both  as a pottery and as a distributor of goods from other manufacturers.  Pottery production stopped in 1960, but the  company remained open as a popular retail outlet until late summer 2009,  switching owners to friends of the Singers a couple times before the last owner  retired. As far as I know this was the only cow mold (#635) that Pearl used, and these  were the only three colors in which they were produced.  From the frequency with which they appear on  eBay, they were quite popular at one time. Pearl apparently did make some for other  locations or organizations to sell as souvenirs –a yellow one with a Pikes Peak picture is shown on the Advertising and  Souvenirs page.  </p></td>

A small container used to hold the water which is added to the  inkstone ‘suzuri’ during the grinding of the ink stick. Water-droppers may be  made of copper, jade and stone, but ceramic are the most popular. Depending on  their size and shape, water-droppers may also be termed suichuu,  suichuujou  (also suijou), suiu  or senjo. More specifically, a suiteki has  two small holes for water and air and is designed so that only a few drops of  water can fall at one time. Suichuu are shaped like pitchers and have a pouring  spout and a handle. Suiu and suijou are bowl or jar-like, and some have wide  mouths, making them popular for use as brush washers (hissen), while others  have small mouths. Senjo, or &quot;toad&quot;, was so named because a toad was  believed to hold water in its large belly. Thus many jade toad-shaped  water-droppers exist. At first the suiteki was simply a jar or bowl used for  holding water, but as interest in the accoutrements of calligraphy grew,  water-droppers became more specialized. Bronze water-droppers in the shapes of  fantastic creatures [monsters], ceramic suiu and teapot-shaped suichuu were  created in China  and found their way to Japan  and became popular with the literati of the Edo  period. In Japan,  suiteki were already used in the Nara  period (7c) when sutra copying flourished. A set from this period made up of a  bronze water-dropper, a spoon and a tray used to hold the ink stick are  preserved at Houryuuji, Nara.  Since the late Heian period (11c), a special kind of writing box ‘suzuribako’,  which includes the water-dropper, in addition to the ink stone and other  writing tools, became very popular. The water-droppers varied greatly in  material, shape and design. Notable, are the elaborately designed ceramic  suiteki, including many animal-shaped examples, that were found among old Seto  (13c) and Oribe (16c) wares (see ‘setoyaki’, ‘oribeyaki’) Water-droppers of  richly colored cloisonne (shippou) also became popular from the 16c.” I sure  hope JAANUS doesn’t mind my passing on their information to cow-creamer  collectors. </p></td>

          <td><p>This small but very well done early 20c copper or bronze  suiteki of a boy with a flute riding a water buffalo came to me from Okayama,  Japan, which is about half-way between Kobe and Hiroshima.  The seller told me that the boy or man riding  a water buffalo is a traditional theme of Zen Buddhism – which of course sent  me to digging through the web.  I learned  that this is a representation of the sixth stage from an early Taoist story of  the ‘Ten Bulls’  that (according to  Wikipedia) may represent a Zen Buddhist interpretation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhumi_(Buddhism)" title="Bhumi (Buddhism)">ten stages</a> experienced by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> as outlined in various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana_sutras" title="Mahayana sutras">Mahāyāna sūtras</a>. The wikipedia article states that the story as related by  the 12c  Chinese Zen master Kuòān  Shīyuǎn has pictures, poems and short pieces of prose that “tell how the  student ventures into the wilderness in his search for &quot;the Bull&quot; (or  &quot;Ox&quot;; a common metaphor for enlightenment, or the true self, or  simply a regular human being), and how his efforts prove fruitless at first.  Undeterred, he keeps searching and eventually finds footprints on a riverbank.  When he sees the bull for the first time he is amazed by the splendour of its  features ('empty and marvellous' is a well known phrase used to describe the  perception of Buddha nature). However, the student has not tamed the bull, and  must work hard to bring it under control. Eventually he reaches the highest  Enlightenment, returns to the world and ‘everyone I look upoon becomes  enlightened’.” The sixth stage has the man riding the bull home in great joy,  and in the 12c picture he is playing a flute.   Whether or not this is the correct interpretation of this suiteki, many  in my collection  – Chinese as well as  Japanese – feature a person riding, climbing or lying on a standing or  reclining bull (water buffalo).  </p></td>

He selected Seto because of its two  types of high quality clay (kibushi and gaerome), and naturally enough a number  of other artisans followed his lead.    These days Seto is noted for its several ceramics museums and festivals,  as well as ceramic production which now includes industrial appliances as well  as artistic pieces.<strong></strong></p></td>

          <td><p>This beautifully crafted and quite large (7” long) water  buffalo is glazed in what the seller termed ‘sang de boeuf’. From Carters.com  we learn that “Flambé glazes, termed  ‘sang-de-boeuf’ (ox blood) were in use by the Chinese from the 11th century,  and the effect was achieved by using copper oxide as a colouring agent and  firing the object in a reducing atmosphere. In the 18th century the red glaze  often accumulated on the shoulders of vases and bowls, reproducing the effect  of coagulated blood. Sometimes the glaze was often slightly streaked, or  included blue bleeds and wares with these features were prized by collectors in  the 19th century. European potters were not able to master the technique until  the early 20th century.” The glaze on this pot seems to me to be somewhat too  light for that, and is mottled with a grey-green background and dark green  occasional spots. Perhaps some expert can enlighten me.  Like other of my vintage Chinese pieces  the bottom is rough and unglazed. This one is unusual both because of its size,  and because the drip hole (although blocked, if there indeed was one) is its  left nostril. It came to me from northern Wales, but the seller said she  bought it at an antique center in Singapore around the turn of the millennium.</p></td>

          <td>Boys apparently like to climb onto the back of water buffalo. Here are 4 versions – the reddish one in back with the boy with a light colored head is a modern water dropper made of Yixing clay . This clay, from the region near Yixing in Jiangsu province, has been used since the Song Dynasty and is very popular for teapots because their unglazed surfaces absorb traces of the contents, leading to a more complex flavor…thus they should never be washed with detergents, or used for more than one type of tea.  The bark brown one with the boy with a green shirt and purple shorts came to me from the Netherlands and was said by the seller to date from ~1900.  Its quality and the look of the clay lead me to believe that’s not unlikely, and one like this may have served as the model for the others. The dark green one on the lower left is less well molded, glazed on the bottom, and likely somewhat younger. It came to me via an antique shop in Missouri. The fourth, of brown clay in the upper left comes from a slightly different mold; the boy’s head is larger and his face more expressive, and the fill hole if on the water buffalo’s but rather than the boy’s back.</td>

It was manufactured  in fairly vast areas in the southwestern part of East China's Zhejiang  Province. The sites of former celadon kilns and workshops are found throughout  the counties of Lishui, Suichang, Yuehe, Qingtian, and Longquan on the upper  Oujiang River, with Longquan as the production center. There were also many  kiln sites in Pucheng along the Songxi River in the northern part of East  China's Fujian Province”…and more, should you care to go to those sites.  Wikipedia also has a nice article about the many kilns in the area. Pretty  obviously mine – which cost ~$9.   - does  not date from the Song Dynasty; but my attempts to learn more about current  Long Quan kilns from the seller came to naught thanks to his paucity of  English. </p></td>

Sales proceeds, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, have gone to build museums in Vietnam and to pay for further excavation and research. With the discovery of previously unknown ceramic forms and design, the historical and artistic relationship between Vietnam and China has been redefined and the quality from this little known chapter of Vietnamese artistic tradition has been recognized. This piece was purchased in an antique shop in Saigon”.  For more information about the shipwreck,  go to <a href="http://www.thingsasian.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thingsasian.com/</a> and search for Hoi An shipwreck.  Really neat stories here. </p></td>

          <td colspan="2"><p>My Webster’s third International  Dictionary defines rhyton as “an ancient Greek drinking horn of pottery, usu.  having the base in the form of the head of an animal, woman, or mythological  creature.”  Wikipedia is much more  expansive, stating “A <strong>rhyton</strong> (plural <strong>rhytons</strong> or, following the Greek plural, <strong>rhyta</strong>) is a  container from which fluids were intended to be drunk or to be poured in some  ceremony such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>. The English word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhyton" title="wiktionary:rhyton">rhyton</a> originates in the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word ῥυτόν (<em>rhy̆tón</em> or <em>rhŭtón</em>).  The conical rhyton form has been known in the Aegean region since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>,  or the 2nd millennium BC. However, it was by no means confined to that region.  Similar in form to, and perhaps originating from, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_horn" title="Drinking horn">drinking horn</a>,  it has been widespread over Eurasia since prehistoric times. (note: I saw some  great Parthian examples in a museum in Ashkabad, Turkmenistan) … Many vessels  considered rhytons featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a  conical constriction at the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that  one scooped wine or water from a storage vessel or similar source, held it up,  unstoppered the hole with one's thumb, and let the fluid run into the mouth (or  onto the ground in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>)… Rhyta were often used for liquids that needed  straining, such as wine, beer and oil. Some rhyta were used in blood rituals  and animal sacrifice. In these cases, the blood may have been thinned with  wine. Some vessels were modeled after the animal they were intended to be used  with during ritual, but this was not always the case… Rhyta occur among the  remains of civilizations speaking different languages and language groups in  and around the Near and Middle East, such as Persia, from the second millennium  BC. They are often shaped like animals' heads or horns and can be very ornate  and compounded with precious metals and stones.”  The Google ‘Images of Rhyton’ page has some  181,000 pictures, and while the majority are of the horn-shaped form, there are  also many that feature a full-bodied caracature of a cow, bull, or other  creature, molded much like the ‘modern’ cow creamer or pitcher.  Indeed, some of those pictures are of works  from modern artists’ (including William Morris). </p>
            <p>This section of my collection does not include any of the ancient (<u></u>BCE<u></u>) rhytons  – those are either in museums or extremely expensive. It does however  have a few that appear to be copies of the ancient ones, as well as modern  vessels that are designed for the same uses for which rhytons  were intended.  Thus here I show the Spanish ‘cruets’ that are  intended for wine or condiments, the Peruvian Torito  de Pucara  (both of  these are also shown on the ‘Places’ page) , and some quite large  bull shaped vessels that would serve well for libations. I also have several  liquor decanters –  the best of those are  found on the Faience page because of their style and makers. Also, the Hindu Nandi – designed for libations of holy water in Hindu  Temples devoted to Shiva – could easily fall into this general category,  though I have accumulated enough of them that they have their own area at the  bottom of the Teapots page because I initially thought they were Indian teapots.   There are also many Chinese bronze cow and bull vessels that are designed to  hold wine or other liquids and clearly fit in this category, albeit my  collection does not (as yet) include any of them.</p></td>

          <td><p>This unusually shaped, hard red  clay cow or bull reads “Ron de Salamanca” on its chest.&nbsp; There are  Salamancas in both Spain  and Mexico,  but given that this bull is made to tote Ron (rum), as well as its shape and  coloration, I’m betting on the latter. And I’m guessing that the Ron was for  drinking, not pouring on the ground.  It  nearly didn’t make it into the collection because it came with the handle badly  broken in shipping (thus the eBay seller refunded the price), as well as a  missing horn. Then I broke the other horn.&nbsp; But it was so unusual that I  decided to see if I could patch it up, and here it is, looking not too bad at  least from a distance. </p></td>

          <td><p>The plain brown bull  pitcher here is unmarked.  It’s  companion, which has “VINO” embossed on its right side and a connected large T  and small R on the left, is apparently the same ceramic pitcher, but  beautifully wrapped in varnished goatskin parchment.  The seller indicated that, although unmarked,  it was most likely attributed to Aldo Tura, an Italian  artist-craftsman-designer who began his furniture and decorative object  business in the 1930’s (see www.tura.it).   I’ve poked around a bit and found that Tura did indeed make quite a  number of parchment-wrapped bar accessories as well as bars and other  furniture, and some of the accessories seem to have been marked with a green  label stuck to the bottom, which may have fallen off of this piece.  If it is indeed a Tura then I got a heck of a  bargain…and if not, at least I’ve now got a really classy goatskin-parchment  wrapped vino jug.</p>
              <p>Update:  Since I acquired  the leather-wrapped bull I’ve seen several others on offer in various  conditions and with different brands.   One, in pretty tough shape, had a label that read “Artesania Raymon,  Made in Spain, Ref 125”.  I’ve not been  able to find out anything about this company except that it’s in Valencia, and  has made a variety of other leather-wrapped glass and pottery items.  I think this attribution is more likely than  Tura.</p></td>

            I suppose most of these might be cruets as opposed to  creamers…but they  certainly meet the two-hole rule.  The first one we got was the reddish brown  clay one in the middle with the earrings – in a shop in San Gimignano, Italy,  in 1990; it carries fond memories of a pleasant vacation in central Italy, and a  fascinating old town of nine towers.   Great wine in the area, too! The only other one of these that’s marked  is the dark brown one on the far left, from Enesco and made in Japan.  The little grey-blue cup with cow head spout  on the far right is hand made, and almost certainly comes from somewhere in the  US;  the eBay seller was in Arizona.</p></td>
