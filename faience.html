                        <p>From reviews on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>, I found that;</p>
                        <p><br>
                            “Faience  is generally defined as tin glazed earthenware. It is a mixture of local clays  to which oxide of tin is added, so that it can become opaque and take on a  white color. Hiding the impurities of the underlying clay body, it imitates the  fineness of porcelain. A hand painted decoration is added to the clear surface.  Faience became popular in Holland,   Italy and France in the  17th century.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The  more commonly known European towns important in Faience production in the late  19th and 20th centuries include Blois, CA, Charolles, Desvres, Gien, Luneville,  Moustiers, Nevers, Quimper, St Clement and others. Faience ranges from  tableware, through jardinieres and fountains, to clocks.&nbsp;<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>“Faience  potteries, or tin-enameled earthenware, date back to ancient times. The actual  name &quot;faience&quot; comes from &quot;Faenza&quot;,  a town in Italy,  and was introduced in France  in the 16th Century by migrant Italian potters. Earlier on, faience had often  been thought to be nothing more than peasant ware, and not appropriate in  elegant French chateaus or palaces. However, in the mid 19th Century, France  and its royalty fell into financial crises after numerous wars and other  national economic disasters.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The  Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 19th Century brought new manufactured  products and improved distribution of these goods. A newly emerged middle class  sought items of aesthetic beauty for their lives and in their homes. Mass  production allowed ordinary people to enjoy luxuries of life in a new era of  economic independence.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The  faience pottery of the late 19th and early 20th Century revived a long history  of the potters’ art, and embodied an artistic and social statement of the  times. The earlier historic decors of Nevers, Rouen, Moustiers, Strasbourg, and Marseilles were captured and reproduced by  factories at Quimper,  Desvres, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Malicorne and  others.”</p>
                        <p>While I have seen lots of  faience at antique fairs, I have found very few cow creamers.  The ones that I do have, however, are very  lovely.</p>

They are still in business, and you can see a variety of their current  wares (no cows at the moment but they tell me they are in the process of  designing one) and learn about their history and manufacturing process at their  website, <a href="http://www.roullet-renoleau.fr/" target="_blank">www.roullet-renoleau.fr</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  There I learned that the founder “was  born in Mansle in 1854, son of a hairdresser. It is when doing his  &quot;military service&quot;, in Paris that he discovers Bernard Palissy's work  (Bernard Palissy was a French chemist, inventor, or rather initiator, in France  of the enameled pottery, known&nbsp;since as&nbsp; earthenware…)… After trials starting in 1880 in Mansle, then  effective productions in Roumazières”… Renoleau started the still operating  pottery in Angouleme, in the Poitou-Charentes region of France. &nbsp;He had no  children of his own, but adopted a nephew Joseph Roullet who took over the firm  after Renoleau’s death, leading to the Pottery’s (and the current, 5th  generation potter’s) name.</p></td>

The other two have crests, one that I don’t  recognize and the other (right picture, smallest cow) from Dieppe.   Since St Malo and Dieppe  were both noted tourists spots, I think it most likely that these cows date  from the late 19c or early 20c, pre-WW I when folks still purchased lovely  items like this as souvenirs of their vacations. </p></td>

From Wikipedia I also learned that  the ~1066 Bayeux  Tapester has a section that shows “Here the knights of Duke William fight  against the men of Dinan”.</p></td>

In the 1870’s the heyday of Desvres pottery began as the  Formaintraux family of potters perfected their craft in the style and manor of  old Rouen.  Their retail operations provided cachepots, jardinières, plates, candlesticks,  miniatures, and other decorative items. Desvres pottery is known for a creamy  white background decorated with bright “Delft”  blue, brilliant lemon yellow, iron red and sage green.”  I’ve shown the base with its marks, and as  always would appreciate help in attribution.</p></td>
