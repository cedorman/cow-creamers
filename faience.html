          <h1>Faience</h1>
          <p>From reviews on <a href="http://www.ebay.com">www.ebay.com</a>, I found that;</p>
		  
          <p>
            “Faience is generally defined as tin glazed earthenware. It is a mixture of local clays to which oxide of
            tin is added, so that it can become opaque and take on a white color. Hiding the impurities of the
            underlying clay body, it imitates the fineness of porcelain. A hand painted decoration is added to the
            clear surface. Faience became popular in Holland, Italy and France in the 17th century. The more commonly known European towns important in Faience production in the late 19th and 20th
            centuries include Blois, CA, Charolles, Desvres, Gien, Luneville, Moustiers, Nevers, Quimper, St Clement
            and others. Faience ranges from tableware, through jardinieres and fountains, to clocks.<br>
          </p>
		  
          <p>“Faience potteries, or tin-enameled earthenware, date back to ancient times. The actual name
          <em>"faience"</em> comes from <em>"Faenza"</em>, a town in Italy, and was introduced in France in the
            16th Century by migrant Italian potters. Earlier on, faience had often been thought to be nothing more than
            peasant ware, and not appropriate in elegant French chateaus or palaces. However, in the mid 19th Century,
            France and its royalty fell into financial crises after numerous wars and other national economic
            disasters.
          </p>
		  
          <p>“The Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 19th Century brought new manufactured products and improved
            distribution of these goods. A newly emerged middle class sought items of aesthetic beauty for their lives
            and in their homes. Mass production allowed ordinary people to enjoy luxuries of life in a new era of
            economic independen.  The faience pottery of the late 19th and early 20th Century revived a long history of the potters’ art,
            and embodied an artistic and social statement of the times. The earlier historic decors of Nevers, Rouen,
            Moustiers, Strasbourg, and Marseilles were captured and reproduced by factories at Quimper, Desvres,
            Boulogne-sur-Mer, Malicorne and others.”</p>
			
			<blockquote>
          <p>While I have seen lots of faience at antique fairs, I have found very few cow creamers.  The ones that I
            do have, however, are very lovely.</p></blockquote>

                <p>These four lovely examples come from the studios of Faiencerie Artisanale Roullet-Renoleau, founded
                  by Alfred Renoleau (1854-1930) in 1896. They are still in business, and you can see a variety of
                  their current wares (no cows at the moment but they tell me they are in the process of designing one)
                  and learn about their history and manufacturing process at their website, <a href="http://www.roullet-renoleau.fr/"
                    target="_blank">www.roullet-renoleau.fr</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There I learned that the founder “was born
                  in Mansle in 1854, son of a hairdresseThese four lovely examples come from the studios of Faiencerie
                  Artisanale Roullet-Renoleau, founded by Alfred Renoleau (1854-1930) in 1896. Back around 2008 or so I
                  found that they were still in business, and learned about their history and manufacturing process at
                  their then website, www.roullet-renoleau.fr There I learned that the founder “was born in Mansle in
                  1854, son of a hairdresser. It is when doing his "military service", in Paris that he discovers
                  Bernard Palissy's work (Bernard Palissy was a French chemist, inventor, or rather initiator, in
                  France of the enameled pottery, known since as earthenware…)… After trials starting in 1880 in
                  Mansle, then effective productions in Roumazières”… Renoleau started the faiencerie in Angouleme, in
                  the Poitou-Charentes region of France. He had no children of his own, but adopted a nephew Joseph
                  Roullet who took over the firm after Renoleau’s death, leading to the Pottery’s and succeeding
                  owners’ names, Roullet-Renoleau. On New Years Day 2019 I decided to revisit their web site, and found
                  to my dismay that it now takes you to a shoe store. Egad, what a shock. A frantic web search turned
                  up a 10 Nov 2012 article in www.charentelibre.fr that informed me that the great-grand-nephew of the
                  founder, René-Marie Roullet-Renoleau, had sold the business in 2010, but then the buyer failed.
                  Determined not to abandon the proud history of the firm, not to mention the more than 120 molds and
                  lots of pottery, René-Marie came out of retirement and started again with just three employees - his
                  son Christophe – the 5th generation ceramicist – a decorator and her assistant, in “the historic
                  factory of ‘Bass’ in Saint-Genis-d'Hiersac”. Apparently this effort again came to naught after a few
                  years since a 19 March 2017 article from the same source announced that without a buyer, and due to
                  falling revenues, the Faiencerie would be liquidated. A short video from www.dailymotion.com on 30
                  Nov 2017 shown the remaining inventory being auctioned. A sad story from my perspective as well as
                  for the many others who admired the beautiful faience from this historic firm.</p>

                  or early 20c, pre-WW I when folks still purchased lovely items like this as souvenirs of their

                <p>Well, the collection has now grown to include a 5th from the Renoleau studio, this time marked for
                  ‘Dinan’ and bearing a maker’s mark that looks sort of like an open ‘4’.  Presumably it was decorated
                  by someone other than the ‘master’, or he just left his initials off.  It’s just a bit smaller than
                  the larger St Malo cow.  Like St Malo, Dinan is a popular medieval town for tourists to visit in
                  Brittany.  It sits above the River Rance, and in addition to the port the medieval town on the
                  hilltop features many fine 13c buildings and a 3km section of city walls. From Wikipedia I also
                  learned that the ~1066 Bayeux Tapester has a section that shows “Here the knights of Duke William
                  fight against the men of Dinan”.</p>

                <p>This lovely faience decanter with its cups on metal hooks is by Georges (Geo) Martel of Desvres,
                  France. It is interestingly also marked ‘Cabourg’ on the base, which is a commune in the Calvados
                  department in the Normandy region, so – just like the decanter above marked for Mount St Michel, -it
                  was presumably made for sale at this popular tourist town (we learn from Wikipedia that it was from
                  Cabourg that William the Conqueror drove the troops of Henry 1 of France back into the sea, also that
                  it was a favorite vacation spot for Marcel Proust).   Searching the web for information about Geo
                  Martel, we learn from <a href="http://www.archivespasdecalais.fr">http://www.archivespasdecalais.fr</a>
                  that “In 1900, Georges Martel bought from Gaëtan Level a ceramics factory located in Desvres,
                  specialized in the reproduction of old pieces (Rouen, Delft, Nevers). The first world war brought the
                  production of earthenware to a halt, because most of the staff as well as Georges Martel himself were
                  mobilized. It was not until the intervention of Mrs. Martel-Legrand in the course of the year 1916 to
                  restart the factory. Although Georges Martel is recognized around the world, the war has changed its
                  commercial network and new directions are needed…. In 1927, he worked in parallel; with workshops in
                  iron art. …Unfortunately, the economic, social and political problems of our time are not right for
                  the manufacture, which closes definitively its doors in April 2003. …”.  There is quite a bit of his
                  lovely faience pottery available on a number of sites.<br></p>
                <p>This may also be a good spot to add a bit more about this style of faience, again from the web:
                  “While faience can be created from a wide mixture of clays, it is foremost distinguished by the milky
                  opaque white color achieved by the addition of tin oxide to the glaze. French faience is typically
                  divided into two types. Grand feu (high fire) describes pieces that have been decorated with glaze
                  and metallic oxides before being fired a single time at a high temperature of around 1650°F (900°C).
                  Petit feu (low-fire) faience, developed in the second half of the eighteenth century, refers to a
                  process whereby the clay body is fired before being glazed and decorated with metallic oxides and
                  then fired again at a lower temperature; pieces can also go through a third firing. Grand feu pieces
                  have a more limited color palette that consists of blue, yellow, brown-purple, and green. By
                  contrast, the lower firing temperature of petit feu faience enabled both greater precision in
                  painting techniques and variety in the range of colors.”</p>

                <p>This creamer comes (via eBay) from an antique dealer in Lisse, the Netherlands, who indicated that
                  it was "possibly Fourmaintreau Desvres, circa 1890” (and could provide no further information). 
                  A web article from ‘Arts and Antiques in Florida’, authored by John Beers, notes that “Desvres,
                  situated in north central France, has been a pottery center since early times, having excavated
                  pottery kilns from the Roman era. In the 1870’s the heyday of Desvres pottery began as the
                  Formaintraux family of potters perfected their craft in the style and manor of old Rouen. Their
                  retail operations provided cachepots, jardinières, plates, candlesticks, miniatures, and other
                  decorative items. Desvres pottery is known for a creamy white background decorated with bright
                  “Delft” blue, brilliant lemon yellow, iron red and sage green.”  I’ve shown the base with its marks,
                  and as always would appreciate help in attribution.</p></blockquote>

                <p>These three lovely old creamers came to me from the UK. I haven’t been able to identify the mark,
                  but by virtue of their style and decoration I believe that they are likely 19c faience.</p></blockquote>

                <p>I have included this modern creamer, of fairly standard shape, in the Faience theme because it is
                  clearly marked “Desvres, France”, with a hand-written “Breiz” and a maker’s mark of a circle with
                  rays with a script “GF” inside. It’s by no means as fancy as the older ones, but looks a lot like
                  much of the fairly modern ‘Quimper faience’ I’ve seen at antique fairs.</p>
