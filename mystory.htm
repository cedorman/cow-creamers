        <h1 align="left"><a id="h1"></a>My Story</h1>
    
      <p align="left"><a href="mystoryimages/dadscow.JPG"><img src="mystoryimages/dadscowr.jpg" alt="Dad's Cow" width="200" height="140" hspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a> My father (born 1908)  had one cow (<em>right</em>)  when he  was a child. I (born 1940) also had one cow &quot;Bessie&quot;, (<em>below, left</em>) when I was a child. When I was a good boy and finished my milk it  gave me more. My wife and I got one for each of our three boys (born in  the ‘60s).  Put 5 cows together, and they  start to make a herd.<a href="mystoryimages/mycowbessie.JPG"><img src="mystoryimages/mycowbessier.jpg" alt="bessie the cow" width="150" height="125" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="left"></a> </p>
      <br>
      <p>For a long time, I just occasionally picked one up at a flea  market; and my price limit was $10.  Nevertheless,  the collection slowly grew till it numbered 50 or so; we had them on shelves  around the top of the kitchen, and then when we moved to an older house there  were some shelves in the guest bathroom where we put them, and our many guests  used to get a great kick out of them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Everything was fine until we moved to London in 1995. From visits to the Victoria and Albert museum, the Bermondsey  Market, antique shows, the Silver Vaults, and Stoke-on-Trent  I learned a bit about the history of cow creamers and had a chance to see some  superb Staffordshire and silver examples.   At that point I decided that I might as well get serious about my own  collection, and quite obviously the price limit disappeared.  </p>
      <p>One other thing happened, in spite  of my initial reluctance – the collection expanded to include cow shaped  vessels designed for pouring but not really intended for cream.  Some of this was by error on my part – what I  took to be a cow creamer turned out to be designed for wine, water, or some  other liquid; or some cows that are more or less shaped and styled like  creamers are simply too large for any civilized cream user, and thus likely  intended for milk or water. And, I will confess, as the collection grew I  decided to add other vessels that met the basic rule of being cow or cow-head  shaped and designed to pour or dispense liquid – thus pitchers, teapots,  calligraphy water droppers, a variety of what can be referred to as rhytons  (see the history page) or liquor or wine dispensers, some toy milking cows, and  even watering cans joined in.  Never (or  almost never except by error) plain non-pouring cows or salt and pepper shakers  – although inevitably, given tea and coffee drinkers’ other bad habit (I take  mine black by the way) sugar bowls, but only when they accompanied a cow creamer.  Thus I’m afraid that this collection is somewhat  misnamed, although the core and to me the most important parts are the cow-creamers  per se, be they new or old, metal or earthenware or plastic.  These now number well over a thousand, and if  one counts the ‘extensions’, the collection probably has a couple thousand  items.  And thanks largely but by  no means solely to eBay (which has had quite an impact both on availability and  price) it continues to grow, weekly if not daily. <br>

restrictive for my tastes however, so a bit of explication  is required.</td>

Like many other functional oriental objects, and in particular calligraphy sets, beauty was as important as utility; and suiteki come in a wide variety of materials and forms (and prices of course).

A variety of liquor dispensers also fall in this  general category.  I don’t own any of the  ancient (BCE) rhytons, but I do have a few modern reproductions and several  intended for non-cow-produced liquids.  </td>

      <p>For those of you who search eBay…the term ‘cow creamer’ has almost become generic (there are generally over 1500 on auction…), and I’ve seen all  kinds of animal creamers/pitchers being sold as cow creamers (I’ve been fooled  by some). Cows of interest to me are sometimes also found on eBay under cow or bull pitcher and jug.  If you do decide to shop on eBay be very careful about prices - many sellers seem to have no realistic idea of value, and there are always some looking for a sucker. Same goes for other sites like etsy, mercari, and catawiki.</p>
	     <p> Do I have duplicates? Sure - sometimes  deliberate, e.g. to upgrade to a higher quality version, sometimes by  mistake.  Also, there are a number of  cow creamers that are made by several potteries, or come in a variety of colors or decorations, though I have made no attempt to be 'complete' in that regard.</p>
