          <p>Where does one draw the line for miniatures?  Well, doll-house size, 1/12 scale (or smaller) creamers
            clearly qualify.  I’ve also chosen to place some slightly larger ones in this category, mainly based on
            the fact that many of them seem too tiny to effectively serve as real creamers, at least for more than a
            skimpy serving for a very small person.  And, this is a mixture of creamers and teapots. </p>

				<p><strong>Doll House (1/12 scale)</strong> : I have found four types of these lovely little dollhouse creamers, based on the material they are made from. The first type is  china or porcelain or some other version of ceramic, like this ‘tea set’ and the very similar but slightly larger teapot. These can be and often are made in fairly large quantities.  The
                    lids of the little teapots here are the tops of their heads and horns. I have seen this set on ebay but I bought mine from the
                    very delightful Black Butterfly Shop on Royal Street in New Orleans in 2000. This shop is run by
                    Myra Landry and her brother Norbert, the 3rd generation of their family to operate it. It survived
                    Katrina, but according to a Washington Post article from their web page, business hasn’t been the
                    same since. The separate cow came from the UK by eBay. I don’t know the maker of either of these.

                <p>Here is a very special and quite old  dollhouse-size (albeit somewhat larger than 1/12 scale) Staffordshire style creamer.  I know it's not unique because I have two (forgot I had the first when the second came up).  The
                  seller stated that she discovered this one  hidden behind the curtains of the Nantucket  (MA) Fletcher
                  house.  She notes that there is mention in the museum documentation that it is from Holland and from
                  the 1880s, possibly earlier.  I do believe that the Holland attribution is correct, from the sketch
                  of what looks very much like a Dutch girl on the base.  She goes on to state that “This cow creamer
                  was a part of a beautiful Dollhouse created by Cara Van Campen Fletcher, born in 1902. This
                  magnificent house is a copy of the original Fletcher House still standing in Nantucket and built by
                  the Fletcher Family in the 1830s. The estate, farm and caretaker’s cottage was gifted to the Flint
                  Museum of Arts in Michigan in 1957 and Deaccessioned in 2010. The original house measures 58” in
                  length, is three stories tall, ten rooms and a widow’s walk on the roof. The main house was
                  originally built in the 1920’s, Mrs. Van Campen-Fletcher had it shipped to her in 1950 from Nantucket
                  and began the painstaking work of completing the house, farm and caretaker’s cottage”. This creamer
                  is one of several hundred pieces from the dollhouse.</p>

                <p>Here starts an area of the page with lovely miniature cow creamers and spill vases from V&R Miniatures (<a href="http://rachelsart.ueuo.com" 
                    target="_blank"> http://rachelsart.ueuo.com" </a>). This is the company of Vaughan (sculptor) and
                  Rachel (artist) Williams, who  design and make a beautiful line of handcrafted 
               (like these creamers) and other porcelain doll house
                  miniatures. They’re located at Lakeside View,  Bwlch-y-Garreg, Pontdolgoch, Caersws, Powys, Wales  (quite
                  a mouthful; I've checked the vicinity on Google Earth and it's lovely countryside, fields and hedgerows). They have a great web site, and do superb workmanship.  To quote from the introduction to their site, "Following traditional pottery techniques from original model to plaster mould, slip casting, firing, glaze and on-glaze firings, there are so many stages to completion! Some of the designs were inspired by English Staffordshire pottery circa 1750 to 1850. They are suitable for most dollhouses. As well as the slip cast pieces we also make many one of a kind Staffordshire miniatures. We also make a wide variety of birds, animals and teapots, and we can custom make individual pieces to order." As you can tell from the pictures, these two pairs  - decorated with blue dots on the left, and delft-like patterns on the right -- vary similar but by no means identical.

                  (valeriecasson.com) notes that she was born in Britain but moved to Provence in 2002 and is now a
                  committed Francophile as well as a maker of many lovely miniatures (but only this one type of cow
                  creamer). The one on the right bears a sticker that says “BB”, and came from the estate of Mary
                  Werth, who was ‘Den Mother’ for the worldwide miniature group The Camp. I hadn’t realized that there
                  were as many such groups as there seem to be – but in poking around I found a site for the National

			<p>The second type of miniature cow creamer is <strong>plastic</strong>. I have only two of these, and one is silver colored so it's down with its real silver cousins. Here, standing on the nose of George, is a plastic one I was delighted to find - a miniature Moo Cow creamer, measureing a half inch tall an a quarter inch wide. To learn about Moo Cow Creamers, go to the Advertising and Souvenir page where there is quite a bit of information about them...but basically, they were very popular in the 1970s, and millions were sold. This little beauty was crafted by Anna Rupp who lives in Michigan and trades as Woodland Trail Whimsy.  Best I can tell she doesn't havce a separate web site, but you can find her cute and tiny creations on Etsy.</p></td>

                <p>On the left, the lovely little dark brown and white cow on a stand that looks like a rock came (via eBay) from the UK.  It doesn’t have any markings, but the quality of the pottery and the shape of the head and ears makes me think that it might be German. The one on  the right is also from the UK, again with no markings for maker or locale.</p></blockquote>

                <p> These are all American. The one in the middle in the left picture bears a silver sticker for "Rio
                  Hondo Potteries, El Monte Calif, Made in California". Rio Hondo made figurines from 1939 to the
                  mid-1950s, according to the list of California Potteries in Wikipedia. This was apparently a popular
                  mold, used by a number of other potteries - including perchance Suwannee. They can  quite often be
                  found for offer on ebay. The cute but pensive little cow on the right is unmarked but from the nature
                  of the ceramic and the expression, it must almost certainly be from the US. I have never seem another
                  like it.</p></blockquote>

                <p>These three little bulls are Torito’s de Pucara – little bulls of Pucara, from Peru.  This form dates
                  from the days of the Spanish colonization, since there were no bulls in Peru until the Spanish
                  brought them.  In their normal size they serve as ritual elements for cattle branding ceremonies, as
                  prosperity and good luck charms found on the roofs of many Peruvian homes, and of course as souvenirs.  You will
                  find some bigger ones  and more information about them on both the Places and the Rhytons pages.  I was delighted to find the
                  miniature simple clay versions on eBay.  The little black one that came from Novica is by Maribel Posso Olivares who with a friend now heads a workshop with about 12 artisans, creating ‘alasitas’ which are tiny items reflecting wishes.   These three little toritos are all shown in the company of their larger colleagues on the Rhytons page.</p>

			<p> Three very different ones here - on the left, the long necked cute creamer with the big eyelashes is artisan-made, bought in an antique  shop in Salisbury MD. It bears a flower like symbol and "B 'by P"  The 'latte' creamer has a mark that says  from“ZOPPOLA, PN, M.G.R.”, with something around the outside and “Made in Italy”, albeit I got it at an antique and collectibles shop in Shrewsbury PA. The little patriotic one on the right is simply an inexpensive eBay purchase. There's a similar blue and white one further down the page.</p></blogkquote>

                    ceramics for the foreign market. On the right is a reddish head pitcher from Japan, accompanied by
                    a tiny American cow "face jug". Neither of these are creamers per so, but I got the pitcher because
                    of its similarity to larger ones, and couldn't resist the ugly but typical little face jug even
