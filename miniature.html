          <h1>Miniatures</h1>
          <p>Where does one draw the line for miniatures?  Well, doll-house size, 1/12 scale (or smaller) creamers
            clearly qualify.  I’ve also chosen to place some slightly larger ones in this category, mainly based on
            the fact that many of them seem too tiny to effectively serve as real creamers, at least for more than a
            skimpy serving for a very small person.  And, this is a mixture of creamers and teapots. </p>

                <p>Lets start the Miniatures catgory  with avery special and quite old  dollhouse-size (somewhat larger than 1/12 scale) Staffordshire style creamer.  I know it's not unique because I have two (forgot I had the first when the second came up).  The
                  seller stated that she discovered this one  hidden behind the curtains of the Nantucket  (MA) Fletcher
                  house.  She notes that there is mention in the museum documentation that it is from Holland and from
                  the 1880s, possibly earlier.  I do believe that the Holland attribution is correct, from the sketch
                  of what looks very much like a Dutch girl on the base.  She goes on to state that “This cow creamer
                  was a part of a beautiful Dollhouse created by Cara Van Campen Fletcher, born in 1902. This
                  magnificent house is a copy of the original Fletcher House still standing in Nantucket and built by
                  the Fletcher Family in the 1830s. The estate, farm and caretaker’s cottage was gifted to the Flint
                  Museum of Arts in Michigan in 1957 and Deaccessioned in 2010. The original house measures 58” in
                  length, is three stories tall, ten rooms and a widow’s walk on the roof. The main house was
                  originally built in the 1920’s, Mrs. Van Campen-Fletcher had it shipped to her in 1950 from Nantucket
                  and began the painstaking work of completing the house, farm and caretaker’s cottage”. This creamer
                  is one of several hundred pieces from the dollhouse.</p>

			<td><p>Here is a second early and very special dollhouse cow or rather bull, this time in the form of a rhyton or drinking cup (it is also shown on the Rhyton page).  The English seller acquired it at a "very fanous" toy and doll auction, where the specialist informed her it was Edwardian, made by Wedgewood. The jasper coloration and beautiful molding certainly attests to that origin. Doll houses were very populaer in that era which is what likely induced Wedgewood to nter the game(the seller has a few others by them from the same coillection and auction, but this is the only cow/bull). </p></td>

				<p><strong>Doll House (1/12 scale)</strong> : Moving on to more modern versions, I have found four types of these lovely little dollhouse creamers, based on the material they are made from. The first type is  china or porcelain or some other version of ceramic, like this ‘tea set’ and the very similar but slightly larger teapot. These can be and often are made in fairly large quantities.  The
                    lids of the little teapots here are the tops of their heads and horns. I have seen this set on ebay but I bought mine from the
                    very delightful Black Butterfly Shop on Royal Street in New Orleans in 2000. This shop is run by
                    Myra Landry and her brother Norbert, the 3rd generation of their family to operate it. It survived
                    Katrina, but according to a Washington Post article from their web page, business hasn’t been the
                    same since. The separate cow came from the UK by eBay. I don’t know the maker of either of these.

                    target="_blank"> http://rachelsart.ueuo.com" </a>). This is the company of Vaughan (sculptor) and
                  Rachel (artist) Williams, who  design and make a beautiful line of handcrafted 
               (like these creamers) and other porcelain doll house
                  miniatures. They’re located at Lakeside View,  Bwlch-y-Garreg, Pontdolgoch, Caersws, Powys, Wales  (quite
                  a mouthful; I've checked the vicinity on Google Earth and it's lovely countryside, fields and hedgerows). They have a great web site, and do superb workmanship.  To quote from the introduction to their site, "Following traditional pottery techniques from original model to plaster mould, slip casting, firing, glaze and on-glaze firings, there are so many stages to completion! Some of the designs were inspired by English Staffordshire pottery circa 1750 to 1850. They are suitable for most dollhouses. As well as the slip cast pieces we also make many one of a kind Staffordshire miniatures. We also make a wide variety of birds, animals and teapots, and we can custom make individual pieces to order." As you can tell from the pictures, these two pairs  - decorated with blue dots on the left, and delft-like patterns on the right -- vary similar but by no means identical.

                  creamer). The one on the right bears a sticker that says “BB”, and came from the estate of Mary
                  Werth, who was ‘Den Mother’ for the worldwide miniature group The Camp. I hadn’t realized that there
                  were as many such groups as there seem to be – but in poking around I found a site for the National

To learn about Moo Cow Creamers, go to the Advertising and Souvenir page where there is quite a bit of information about them...but basically, they were very popular in the 1970s, and millions were sold. This little beauty was crafted by Anna Rupp who lives in Michigan and trades as Woodland Trail Whimsy.

				From vintagejewelsgeek.co.uk and other web sites we learn “At the end of Queen Victoria’s era,
				a jeweller named Walter Archibald Parker Watson (1880 -1952) established a factory in the 
				famous Jewellery Quarter in Hockley Birmingham. However, in 1914 at the onset of World war 
				One, he sold his business to Augustus Harry Power (1878 -1952) and Clarence Oswald Flint 
				(1880 – 1946) This two men kept his name – W.A.P. Watson and eventually became a limited 
				company.” They initially made fine jewelry. Over the years they moved around a lot, did 
				fine metal work during both world wars, eventually switched to costume jewelry and used
				the trade name “Exquisite” from the 1950ss to 70s.  In the 80s they started making pewter 
				pieces, including miniatures like this 1/12 scale cow creamer and bucket sugar bowl. Brand 
				names changed and when Dungreons and Dragons became popular they opened a subsidiary in 
				Texas for that kind of figures then moved to Florida, and as I understand it  the brand 
				name was sold to the Xystos group in 2007. I would guess from all this that this little 
				cow was fashioned from “old English pewter’ in the 1980s. </p>

                  range of prices for them (usually the most for my first example). eBay has been somewhat helpful in
                  determining what is and isn’t REALLY rare (although usually after the fact), in spite of how folks
                  peddle things. In this case, it's the tiniest that I believe to be most scarce.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			<p>These cute very small cow and pig were sold as a sugar and vreamer pair, but enough digging on the weg convinces me otherwise. Lets take them one at a time.</p>
			<p> The tiny but fully functional cow creamer with the puffy cheeks has no indication of its maker, but is obviously a souvennir of Karuizawa. Fom Japan-guide.com and Wikipedia we learn that "Karuizawa (軽井沢) is an upmarket mountain resort at the foot of the active volcano Mount Asama in Nagano Prefecture. Located at an altitude of roughly 1000 meters, the town provides a pleasant escape from the summer heat. It was promoted as a mountain resort by Western residents of Japan in the late 1800s, and today many wealthy urbanites own a second home there. Thanks to the Hokuriku Shinkansen it takes little more than an hour to reach Karuizawa from central Tokyo." "The area of present-day Karuizawa was part of ancient Shinano Province, and developed as Karuisawa-shuku, a post station on the Nakasendō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto during the Edo period....(Mount Asama) is classed as a Category A active volcano. A small eruption was detected in June 2015, a more significant eruption spewing hot rocks and a plume of ash occurred in February 2015. Mt. Asama's most destructive eruption in recent recorded history took place in 1783, when over 1,000 were killed. The volcano is actively monitored by scientists and climbing close to the summit is prohibited." OK, tiny cow souvenir of a volcano...</p>
			<p>I wasnn't even going to bother with the little pig - it;s fashioned as a tiny pitcher - but it has a round pink sticker on the bottom that reads "RUNE" in the middle and "Love Space with Runc Co. Ltd, Made in Japan" around rhe edge. So I hit the web and learned from Wikipoedia that "Rune Naito (Japanese: 内藤 ルネ, Hepburn: Naitō Rune, November 20, 1932 – October 24, 2007) was the pen name of Japanese artist, illustrator, writer, and designer Isao Naito (ないとう いさお, Naitō Isao).His illustrations of "large-headed" (nitōshin) baby-faced girls, first drawn for Japanese magazines in the mid-1950s, are credited with pioneering the contemporary culture and aesthetic of kawaii (lit. "lovable" or "cute"). He is further noted for his contributions to the Japanese gay men's magazine Barazoku, the first commercially circulated gay magazine in Japan." So then I went to Etsy,com and searched under his name and found a whole bunch of little ceramic figures, some with quite hefty price tags, alomg with some of his non-erotic art. So at any rate, after all this effort I figured he deserves a place on a shelf even if not right next to his cow friend.</p></blockquote></td>

                  brought them.  In their normal size they serve as ritual elements for cattle branding ceremonies, as
                  prosperity and good luck charms found on the roofs of many Peruvian homes, and of course as souvenirs.  You will
                  find some bigger ones  and more information about them on both the Places and the Rhytons pages.  I was delighted to find the
                  miniature simple clay versions on eBay.  The little black one that came from Novica is by Maribel Posso Olivares who with a friend now heads a workshop with about 12 artisans, creating ‘alasitas’ which are tiny items reflecting wishes.   These three little toritos are all shown in the company of their larger colleagues on the Rhytons page.</p>

			<p>I have several of these nice Japanese black and white curly-tailed cow creamers , in various sizes and shapes but all more or less similar. This is a very tiny version. On the right is a much uglier or perhaps meaner version of a tiny cow - presumably from either just before or after WWII, and certainly not one of the finer pieces of Japanese ceramics.</p?</td>

                  <p> On the left is a fairly modern Japanese cow creamer.  On the right is a reddish head pitcher from Japan, accompanied by
                    a tiny American cow "face jug". Neither of these are creamers per so, but I got the pitcher because
                    of its similarity to larger ones, and couldn't resist the ugly but typical little face jug even
                    though it doesn't pour.</p></blockquote>

                <p> Tiny teapots should not be left out.  The little farmer holding the milk bottle wouldn’t have a chance of holding a regular sized
                  tea bag, let alone any real tea.  “Collectible” I suppose.  I do find that using a cake as a spout a rather
                  interesting idea.</p>
