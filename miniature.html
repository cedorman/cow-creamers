        <h1>Miniatures</h1>
    <p>Where does one draw the line for miniatures?  Well, doll-house size, 1/12 scale (or  smaller) creamers clearly qualify.  I’ve  also chosen to place some slightly larger ones in this category, largely based  on the fact that many of them seem too tiny to effectively serve as real  creamers, at least for more than a skimpy serving for a very small person.  And, this is a mixture of creamers and  teapots. </p>

                  <p><strong>Doll House (1/12 scale)</strong> : I  have found two types of these; the first is ones made from china or porcelain, like this ‘tea set’ and the very similar but slightly  larger teapot.  Their lids are the tops of their heads and  horns. I have seen this set on ebay but I bought mine from the very delightful Black Butterfly Shop on Royal Street in New Orleans in 2000. This shop is run  by Myra Landry and her brother Norbert, the 3rd generation of their family to operate it. It survived Katrina, but according to a Washington Post article from their web page, business hasn’t been the same since. The separate cow came from the UK by eBay. I don’t know the maker of either of them.  </p>

              <p>Here is a very special and quite old hand made dollhouse  size Staffordshire style creamer.  The  seller stated that she discovered it hidden behind the curtains of the  Nantucket  (MA) Fletcher house.  She notes that there is mention in the museum  documentation that it is from Holland and from the 1880s, possibly  earlier.  I do believe that the Holland  attribution is correct, from the sketch of what looks very much like a Dutch  girl on the base.  She goes on to state  that “This cow creamer was a part of a beautiful Dollhouse created by Cara Van  Campen Fletcher, born in 1902. This magnificent house is a copy of the original  Fletcher House still standing in Nantucket and built by the Fletcher Family in  the 1830s. The estate, farm and caretaker’s cottage was gifted to the Flint  Museum of Arts in Michigan in 1957 and Deaccessioned in 2010. The original  house measures 58” in length, is three stories tall, ten rooms and a widow’s  walk on the roof. The main house was originally built in the 1920’s, Mrs. Van  Campen-Fletcher had it shipped to her in 1950 from Nantucket and began the  painstaking work of completing the house, farm and caretaker’s cottage”. This  creamer is one of several hundred pieces from the dollhouse.</p></td>

              web site seems a bit dated, but indicated that they sell doll house miniatures  made

Its companion in this section is painted to resemble the Chinese ‘blue willow’  transfer printed creamers that were extremely popular in the mid 19c.</p></td>

          <p>Here are two very similar cow creamers, from different artisans. The one on the left is from France, made and signed by Valerie Anne Casson, a miniaturist for over 30 years. Her web site (valeriecasson.com) notes that she was born in Britain but moved to Provence in 2002 and is now a committed Francophile as well as a maker of many lovely miniatures (but only this one type of cow creamer). The one on the right bears a sticker that says “BB”, and came from the estate of Mary Werth, who was ‘Den Mother’ for the worldwide miniature group The Camp. I hadn’t realized that there were as many such groups as there seem to be – but in poking around I found a site for the National Association of Miniature Enthusiasts, and they show a map of the US where you can click on your state and find our what clubs are there (none in Alaska!) …or you can also go to the directory at myminiatures.com.

Indeed, I had no ides  how many varieties there were until I visited <a href="http://www.epiphany-figures.com/">www.epiphany-figures.com</a>, which  takes you to “Faboland – Jean-Marie Collections”. Once there I naturally went  to the ‘Themes’ section, and lo and behold there is a whole section on ‘vaches’  including this little “le The de vaches” set. </p>

Rio Hondo made figurines from 1939 to the mid-1950s, according to the list of California Potteries in Wikipedia.  This was apparently a popular mold, used bu a number of other potteries - including perchance Suwannee. They can be quite often found for offer on ebay. The cute but pensive little cow on the right is unmarked but from the nature of the ceramic and the expression, it must almost certainly be from the US. I have never seem another like it.</p></td>
