            <h1 align="left"><a id="h1"></a>Rhytons</h1>
            
            <p>My Webster’s third International Dictionary defines rhyton as “an ancient Greek
            drinking horn of pottery, usu.  having the base in the form of the head of an animal,
            woman, or mythological creature.” Wikipedia is much more expansive, stating
            “A <strong>rhyton</strong> (plural <strong>rhytons</strong> or, following the Greek
            plural, <strong>rhyta</strong>) is a container from which fluids were intended to be
            drunk or to be poured in some ceremony such
            as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>. The
            English word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhyton"
            title="wiktionary:rhyton">rhyton</a> originates in the
            ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek
            language">Greek</a> word ῥυτόν (<em>rhy̆tón</em> or <em>rhŭtón</em>).  The conical rhyton
            form has been known in the Aegean region since
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>,
            or the 2nd millennium BC. However, it was by no means confined to that region.  Similar
            in form to, and perhaps originating from,
            the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_horn" title="Drinking horn">drinking
            horn</a>, it has been widespread over Eurasia since prehistoric times. (note: I saw some
            great Parthian examples in a museum in Ashkabad, Turkmenistan) … Many vessels considered
            rhytons featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a conical constriction at
            the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that one scooped wine or water from a
            storage vessel or similar source, held it up, unstoppered the hole with one's thumb, and
            let the fluid run into the mouth (or onto the ground
            in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libation" title="Libation">libation</a>)… Rhyta
            were often used for liquids that needed straining, such as wine, beer and oil. Some
            rhyta were used in blood rituals and animal sacrifice. In these cases, the blood may
            have been thinned with wine. Some vessels were modeled after the animal they were
            intended to be used with during ritual, but this was not always the case… Rhyta occur
            among the remains of civilizations speaking different languages and language groups in
            and around the Near and Middle East, such as Persia, from the second millennium BC. They
            are often shaped like animals' heads or horns and can be very ornate and compounded with
            precious metals and stones.”  The Google ‘Images of Rhyton’ page has some 181,000
            pictures, and while the majority are of the horn-shaped form, there are also many that
            feature a full-bodied caracature of a cow, bull, or other creature, molded much like the
            ‘modern’ cow creamer or pitcher.  Indeed, some of those pictures are of works from
            modern artists’ (including William Morris). </p>
            
            <p>This section of my collection does not include any of the ancient (<u></u>BCE<u></u>)
            rhytons – those are either in museums or extremely expensive. It does however have a few
            that appear to be copies of the ancient ones, as well as modern vessels that are
            designed for the same uses for which rhytons were intended.  Thus here I show the
            Spanish ‘cruets’ that are intended for wine or condiments, the Peruvian Torito de
            Pucara  (both of these are also shown on the ‘Places’ page) , and some quite large bull
            shaped vessels that would serve well for libations. I also have several liquor decanters
            –  the best of those are found on the Faience page because of their style and
            makers. Also, the Hindu Nandi – designed for libations of holy water in Hindu Temples
            devoted to Shiva – could easily fall into this general category, though I have
            accumulated enough of them that they have their own area at the bottom of the Teapots
            page because I initially thought they were Indian teapots.   There are also many Chinese
            bronze cow and bull vessels that are designed to hold wine or other liquids and clearly
            fit in this category, albeit my collection does not (as yet) include any of
            them.</p>

                certified as original from an antiquities dealer
                in <u></u><u></u>Cyprus<u></u><u></u>.  It was sufficiently inexpensive as these
                things go that I thought it would make a good introductory contribution to this part
                of the collection.  Amlash is a fairly generic term referring to a geographic region
                in northern <u></u><u></u>Iran<u></u><u></u>, and apparently most of the artifacts
                from there date to the 9th-8th century <u></u>BCE<u></u>. A check of the photos on
                google shows that hump backed bulls seemed to be popular items for Amlash

                indigenous Andean.  However as noted in other places where I have displayed these
                lovely bull vessels, they were initially designed for libations associated with the
                cattle-branding ceremony, to hold a mixture of blood and chicha (corn-based beer). 
                Thus they certainly meet the basic (expanded) definition. They have become a very
                popular souvenir of Peru, and also are often found in pairs on newly-completed roofs
                of houses, bearing a bottle each of chicha and holy water.</p></td>

                dedicated to perpetuating the beauty oif Peruvian ceramic art. The little black one

                artisans, creating ‘alasitas’ which are items reflecting wishes. Novics states that
                its mission is to spread happiness – to both the artisans and to their customers,

                torito of pucara is a ceramic handicrafts of the district of Pupuja, in the province
                of Azángaro, Peruvian department of Puno.  It is a totemic symbol known as qonopas
                (Quechua) and / or Illas (Aymara), used in Andean rituals and ceremonies of
                protection, happiness and fertility in married life. In the perception of the Andean
                settlers that the pair of pucará toritos on the roof is a sign of protection and
                happiness in the home, it is an Andean duality that represents the husband and the
                woman that represent the fusion of positive and negative energies that the
                Equilibrium And the common good.  At present, this piece has become a symbol of
                Peruvian Andean identity. The singular finish of the toritos are imperfect figures,
                of rough aspect, although they are charming and handmade in all ways. The objects
                are tied with the sheepskin and the black color is because they are destined to be
                buried in the day of the Pachamama the 1 of August of each year.”</p></td>

                which may have fallen off of this piece.  If it is indeed a Tura then I got a heck
                of a bargain…and if not, at least I’ve now got a really classy goatskin-parchment
                wrapped vino jug.</p>
                  <p>Update:  Since I acquired  the leather-wrapped bull I’ve seen several others on offer in various  conditions and with different brands.   One, in pretty tough shape, had a label that read “Artesania Raymon,  Made in Spain, Ref 125”.  I’ve not been  able to find out anything about this company except that it’s in Valencia, and  has made a variety of other leather-wrapped glass and pottery items.  I think this attribution is more likely than  Tura.</p></td>

                carries fond memories of a pleasant vacation in central Italy, and a fascinating old
                town of nine towers.   Great wine in the area, too! The only other one of these
                that’s marked is the dark brown one on the far left, from Enesco and made in
                Japan.  The little grey-blue cup with cow head spout on the far right is hand made,
                and almost certainly comes from somewhere in the US; the eBay seller was in
