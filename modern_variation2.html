		  <p> This page starts with a few more blue cow and white cow creamers, then red ones and a couple others, followed by a bunch of cows with flowers, then miscellaneous ones from around the world. Then there is a subsection with cows that resemble each other, coming from the same or similar molds or just being similar interpretations, including a few more Elsies and Elsie knock-offs like those that were featured on the Advertising and Souvenirs page. Page 2 concludes with my small but prized collection of coww creamers or pitchers from the Acoma Pueblo.</p>

                    in Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany.  They were not sold as a set, and although the kneeling cow
                    might be intended for sugar it also has a mouth hole so perhaps it can equally well serve for a
                    liquid (or maybe you’re supposed to pour the sugar).</p>

                    from one of their molds.  There is a bit about them along with a similar creamer accompanied by a
                    teapot in the England section of the Favorite Brands page, and also a couple more teapots -
                    including a blue and white one - on the Teapots page.  This one came with a sticker on the base
                    from a British dealer in antiques and ‘objets d’arte’, as well as a tag around its neck from a
                    December 2001 Antiques Fair in Newark.  From there it went into the extensive collection of a
                    Belgian gentleman, and I got it as his collections was being sold off in pieces at the Catawiki
                    auction site.</p>

                  the early the 2010’s, from white to colored, with the sellers of kitchenware offering rather simple
                  cows in a choice of brilliant and sometimes very non-cowish colors.  Here is one example, sold
                  through Walmart (of all places) as well as many others with oodles of ebay offerings from “The Pioneer Woman” as proudly displayed on their tags, and
                  distributed by Gibson Overseas Inc of Commerce, CA.  Yes there is a white one, but it has brilliant
                  flowers and it accompanies its cousins in bright solid teal and red.  And as proof positive of the
                  change in style, on July 18 2011 the Pioneer Woman herself (Ree)  posted a “Life and Style”  note
                  entitled “White Porcelain Cow Creamer” in which she said "Call me crazy, but I
                    really do think this is the perfect gift for so many occasions when you can’t figure out what to
                    get someone. A perfectly white porcelain cow creamer: it doesn’t get any more whimsical, kitschy,
                    fun, sweet, or shiny than that….” Noting that she had 3 herself, she suggested 4 manufacturers
                    from whom folks could get them at the time.  Then what does she do?? Market her own in red and
                    teal. Egad…</p></td>

                    I’ve already made my point courtesy of ‘Ree The Pioneer Woman’.  These Food Network creamers are
                    widely available, and I bought this one on sale in a Kohl’s department store in Fredricksburg VA
                    while wasting time before a lunch with friends.</p>

                    and Company” which deals in imported home décor and giftware, and on their web site offers
                    sitting as well as standing cow (and other animal) creamers in several bright solid colors. These
                    cows were (what a surprise!) Made in China.  I think the color is closer to mustard, but then
                    interior decoration isn’t my forte.</p>

                  in the making. Throughout our evolution from oil company to diversified chemicals conglomerate, to
                  a global specialty chemicals company, we’ve advanced by becoming ever more capable of adding unique
                  value to customer products.” They list a whole range of industries they supply, but they don’t seem
                  to be in the cow creamer business. Perhaps it’s one of their many subsidiaries.

                  <p>This lovely lady is Molly Creamer and she came to me as a wonderful gift from a dear friend in
                    early 2017. I was amazed because I thought that it would be impossible for someone to actually
                    find one that I didn’t have in a store…in this case, Nieman Marcus.  Molly is a bit unusual with
                    the raised mustard colored rim around her back opening, and the flowers composed of dots.  Like
                    the squat cow above, she has a remedial udder and no teats.  She was handcrafted in Aurora, NY by
                    MacKenzie-Childs, which per their web site was founded in 1983 in the basement of a 1909 building
                    built as a dormitory for a girl’s prep school. They have since moved up in the world, to a lovely
                    farm overlooking Cayuga Lake which they invite you to visit.  Their emblem is a thistle and they
                    have Scottish cattle on the farm, but I find nothing particularly Scottish about Molly.</p>

                    <p>No flowers, but lovely red leaves and berries on this rather amazing greenish porcelain
                      cow with gold horns, tail, hooves and raised gold doily-like or moriage fringe around the back
                      opening.  It bears the mark of I.E.&C. Co of Japan,  as well as ‘Hand Painted”.  Of course
                      this sent me to the web, and after a bit of digging I came across three postings by a retired
                      Canadian policeman by the name of John Henley who has done extensive research into this company
                      and its marks – albeit as he states, their details remain a mystery.  What he has managed to
                      discover is that their wares were “produced during the ‘industrial revolution’ and
                      modernization of the porcelain industry in Japan…from approximately 1885 to 1925.”  They chose
                      not to register their products and mark for the US market, but instead appear to have targeted
                      the British and especially their colonies of Australia and New Zealand, albeit many items that
                      ended up there were brought by emigrants from the home island (my creamer came via eBay from a
                      seller in the US who misidentified it, and could only tell me that he got it in an estate
                      sale).  As Mr Henley notes, their marketing decisions “either lead to a planned exit from the
                      market or the economic collapse of the company in the early 1920s, leaving us with a porcelain
                      product that can match the best of the best and an ongoing mystery.”    For those of you who
                      love the story of a good hunt, start with <a href="http://www.noritakecollectorsguild.info/researchers/johnhenley/index.html">http://www.noritakecollectorsguild.info/researchers/johnhenley/index.html</a>
                      and go on from there to the two pdf files that present his findings, one of which provides a
                      very informative discussion of the Japanese porcelain industry of the period   I have of course
                      sent a picture of this cow to him. He notes that is the first example he has seen, and a
                      variant from their normal product line. But then if they were focused on England and her Asian
                      colonies, then certainly a cow creamer would be a logical item given the Brits’ affinity for
                      these beasts.</p>

                    These three creamers are purported to be Blue Ridge China, the product of Southern Potteries of
                    Erwin, TN (which is not on the Blue Ridge…). From their web site we learn that the site was
                    selected by the Ohio Railroad to stimulate commercial growth along its route, and the pottery was
                    constructed in 1916. The first operators were brought in from similar potteries in Ohio and West
                    Virginia.  By the start of WWI, it was one of the largest producers of hand painted china in the
                    US, with over a thousand employees, half of whom were painters.  Following the war, the pottery
                    succumbed to competition from imports, mostly from Japan, and it closed in early 1957.  If I’m
                    wrong in assigning these to Blue Ridge, I’d appreciate hearing about it.</p>

                  <p>While talking about cows from interesting places, here’s one of the few (except for a Gzhel
                    teapot and a couple other wild teapots) in my collection that comes from Russia.  The seller said
                    this was “Merry Cow”, from the Budy factory, and provided the following information: ““In 1887,
                    the beginning of the work ‘New Kharkov factory MS Kuznetsova in the village of Budy.’ Budy plant
                    was the fourth plant, which came in the ‘Partnership production of porcelain and faience, MS
                    Kuznetsova.’  Partnership has started to operate since 1889 and the beginning of XX century it
                    consisted of 8 major works are already in Russia.   Since 1892 the plant began to make faience.
                    Prior to this (the early years of plant operation, elaborated polufayans)  after the 1917
                    revolution, the factory was nationalized.   In 1922 he joined the Ukrainian Trust
                    ‘Ukrfarforfayanssteklo.’ " This is a whole lot more than I know about most of my cows, so I’m
                    grateful for the information.! </p>

			  <p>One of the interesting aspects of this collection (to me at any rate) is how a style of creamer
                    seems to catch the fancy of the public, and is then copied – either precisely by duplicating a
                    mold or by developing new molds with similar characteristics.  The Jackfield creamers are an
                    early example of this, as are the multiple Elsie’s. Similarly,  the pure white creamers which Williams Sonoma first popularized in the US and are now found in dozens of varieties.  What follows here is a subsection of this page featuring cow creamer 'families' of sorts - similar in shape or style, sometimes almost identical but often just taking advantage of a pupular shape. </p></blockquote></td>

                <td>
                  <p>Here starts one example of family similarity, 
                   dating the best I can tell from the post WWII era – basically, creamers with
                    round or wide open mouths, straight legs, and horns and ears pretty much together and more or
                    less flat across the top.  It would be nice to be able to pick out the cow that started the
                    trend, and while that’s rarely possible, at least in this series we can generally date the style
                    to the late 1940s to mid 1950s, with examples from that era from Japan, Germany, and the US. 
                    Let’s start with this picture of three. The only one with marks is the white cow with a blue
                    ribbon on the right, and she is stamped “Occupied Japan”. This places her sometime after the
                    surrender of Japan on April 14 1945 and before the restoration of independence on April 28 1952 –
                    probably during the latter part of that period when the vast majority of exports so marked were
                    kitchenware. . Although hard to see in this shot she also bears the script word “Elsie” in blue
                    on her left shoulder. As described in some detail and with many examples on the Advertising page,
                    Elsie was first devised as a cartoon character for Borden’s products in 1936, and became very
                    popular following the 1939 New York World’s Fair. This cow bears little resemblance to Borden’s
                    Elsie, but presumably the potter was trying to take advantage of the name since Borden’s Elsie
                    was extremely popular in the 1940s and 1950s. </p>    </td>

                    PA, Made in the Poconos”.  It seems to have been very popular – there are lots like it available
                    both alone and as part of tea sets as shown below, although not all bear the Holley Ross stamp.
                    Here on the right is a creamer from what appears to be the identical mold, but marked for Erwin
                    Pottery of Erwin TN.  The seller stated that it was hand painted by Negatha Peterson, at their
                    request for their daughter. According to several web sites, the decoration on this cow is known
                    as Blue Ridge, developed by Southern Potteries of Erwin TN early in the 20c. Negatha Peterson
                    worked there for 16 years starting in 1941 and when they closed shop in 1957, she and her husband
                    opened Erwin Pottery in 1958 and brought over the Blue Ridge patterns as well as many of the
                    molds.  Holley Ross pottery is still active in the Poconos. They have a web site for their
                    factory showroom which sells many brands of pottery as well as their own -  but it doesn’t have
                    any information on the firm’s history, and nary a coy creamer is in sight. Although Erwin Pottery
                    stopped in 2005 the molds and patterns have apparently been transferred to yet other potters.</p>

                  <p>Here is a similar creamer that although unmarked (except for the 22 carat gold warrant) was
                    advertised as Pope Gosser. A Google search led me to www.ask.com where I found that “In the late
                    1800's, I. Bentley Pope migrated to the United States from England, where he was a master pottery
                    maker. He settled in Coshocton, Ohio, where he met Charles F. Gosser, a jeweler and President of
                    the Coshocton Board of Trade, a group seeking to foster the development of manufacturing in the
                    area. They joined forces and opened Pope-Gosser China in 1902. Early examples of their work were
                    marked with the Clarus Ware mark. Then they went to the Pope-Gosser China mark until 1908 when
                    they adopted the Unicorn mark which graces their chinaware today. The company grew to being an
                    international supplier of fine china and many pieces reside in the British Museum even today.”
                    The description goes on to describe a merger with other companies into the American Chinaware
                    Corporation in the post depression era, followed by bankruptcy after which “the company was
                    reorganized and its lines were streamlined. They were made less expensive and distributed in dime
                    stores and hardware stores.”  I’d guess that if this piece is indeed Pope Gosser, it comes from
                    that era…I’d tentatively date this cow and its relatives in the section above to post-WWII, say
                    the early 1950s. </p>

                    Here is bunch or little roundish creamers that are similar in theme if not all that identical in shape, and that come from all over.  They don’t all have stories, but…the little round guy with the red
                    spots and ‘hair’ came to us from Szeged, Hungary (though I doubt it was made there) – the only
                    cow creamer we found in that country.  I remember that trip well because our luggage had been
                    misplaced, so I ended up with a new Hungarian sport coat, shirt and tie for my appointment that
                    day, and by wife bought the cow for me as a Valentines Day gift while I was ‘working’.  We bought
                    the roundish black and white one that’s next to it in a large department store in Helsinki,
                    Finland, in 1997; my wife gave me one just like it from Reykjavik, Iceland, for Father’s Day in
                    2004.  Cows do get around.</p>

                  <p> Here starts a series of pictures of cow creamers from what has probably been the most widely
                    reproduced modern mold, starting probably in post-WWII Japan in the
                    1950s and continuing through today. These creamers come in a huge range of colors and have been
                    widely used as souvenirs. There are accompanying sugar bowls, salt and pepper shakers, and butter
                    dishes.  As you can see from the pink creamer here lying on its side, some of the earliest
                    versions came with a little bell hung from a wire imbedded in the neck.  I have tended to refer
                    generically to the maker of these as “Kenmar” (about whom I can find no information except that
                    they were from <u></u><u></u>Japan<u></u><u></u>) because many of the early ones are attributed
                    to them.  Whether they were the ones to first design this mold I have no idea – but certainly
                    these have been produced and copied now for some 60+ years, both by a number of Japanese pottery
                    firms, and by makers from other countries.<br>

                    from http://www.quebexport.com/beauceware/indexE.html that “Beauceware (trademark) became an
                    important part of the great industrial adventure of Beauce County, in Quebec country. Established
                    in the first half of the century in 1939, and operating until 1989, the company diffused an
                    innovative image by establishing the production of an industrialized utilitarian art: pottery.”
                    This interesting site gives a nice history of the factory, as well as some useful info about how
                    to determine the age of a piece…I’d guess this cow is from the early 1950’s, given the color of
                    the clay and the lack of any mark.</p>

                    It’s marked “Made in France, Exclusivité CHAMART France”. A web search reveals that “Chamart was
                    the brainchild of founder, Charles Martine. The name ‘Chamart’ is a contraction, a combination of
                    Martine’s given name and surname. Creating the company in the early 1950s, Martine was the first
                    to bring a variety of French porcelains to the United States. In 1965, he introduced the Limoges
                    Box to the American market, designing a collection for Tiffany & Company. It was immensely
                    popular and quickly became the cornerstone of Chamart’s business. Martine’s marked taste,
                    devotion to crafting quality, and insistence that each piece be meticulously handpainted from
                    start to finish, made the Limoges Box become a product for which Chamart is now world famous.”
                     The current president/CEO is the niece of the founder and she has introduced other lines
                    including dinner and serving ware, thus this lovely if standard-shaped cow.</p>

                    different molds, as these two are not quite alike.  The big black one on the left with gold
                    hooves and horns is of red clay; the others are ceramic.  Not all are Japanese – the one in the
                    middle is marked “Coventry Made in USA”, and has their number “5540 B”.  The seller indicated it
                    was from the 1940’s, and probably designed by Elaine Carlock, who was their designer and
                    sculptress. From the ‘ohiolink’ website we learn that  Coventry Ware inc took its name from the
                    township in which it was located; it was originally D’Or studios, which was started in 1932 by
                    Carrie Orr Daum. The studio initially made plaster products, and began to manufacture ceramics in
                    the 40s.  During the war years it produced molds for soldiers’ equipment.  Following the war it,
                    like many other US ceramics firms, lost much of its market to cheaper foreign goods, and it
                    closed in the midl960s.   In the photo of two cows and a bucket, the luster one is unmarked and
                    quite similar to those in the other photo; the white one with the blue and gold garland and gold
                    horns, hooves and bell is quite different, and came accompanied by salt and pepper sharers as
                    well as the bucket sugar.  He has a silver sticker that says Napco Ceramic, Japan, and the number
                    S1294.  The very useful website www.headvasemuseum.com tells us that “Established in 1938 in
                    Bedford, Ohio, the National Potteries Corporation, otherwise known as Napco, imports various
                    styles of ceramic, glass, and china giftware. Irwin Garber, who would later launch INARCO, joined
                    the company in the mid-40s and spearheaded its development of head vases. Owned and operated in
                    the Midwest, Napco distributed a variety of collectibles, including decorative wall accessories,
                    ashtrays, ceramic and wood house wares, floral arrangements, ceramic planters, decorative glass,
                    novelty figurines, mugs, trivets, and Christmas ceramics. Napco used a wide array of marks…”.  My

                    from very different locations.  The yellow one bears a scene entitled “La Veille”, and was indeed

                    the Amalfi Peninsula in Italy.  The white faced one with the bright flowers all over was made in
                    Taiwan, and its neighbor with the pink flowers and tail was ‘handcrafted’ in Thailand.  Flat

                    More look-alikes.  None of the cows in the shot of four are marked, although someone suggested
                    that the ones in the middle are from Dee Lee pottery of California, and the one with the blue
                    flower has “D” written on the bottom.   In the second set, the one on the left that’s basically
                    identical to them is a bit more informative; it has a blue stamp of a palette with “Sleepy Hollow
                    Pottery, Laguna Beach, Calif”, and the written letter “A” – perhaps the same pottery, different
                    painter.  The blue one is unmarked and is obviously from a different mold although with the same
                    basic features (including the udder that sticks out between the legs on both sides, ouch); the
                    one on the right with the flower necklace has written in pencil on the bottom, “”RDE, 2.65”;
                    presumably, the price at one point in its life (I paid 8.99!).  The third photo carries on the
                    theme, although “Roy” and “Batchie”, a bull and cow creamer and sugar set, would appear to come
                    from a paint-it yourself shop.</p>

                    Flat-topped cows with holes in the tops of their heads seem to come in two basic varieties  - 
                    sort of rectangular ones and sort of roundish ones. In the shot of 5, the big white and orange
                    bull only has some numbers.  The brown pitcher to its left is stamped Bavaria, and the potter’s
                    mark is an inverted triangle; the light green one that’s somewhat similar is unmarked.  The
                    little blue guy on the left of both shots is simply stamped Japan.  The other three, with stubby
                    horns and flowers that are holding their tummies with their front legs, have a palette shaped
                    sticker from ARDCO, Fine Quality, Dallas, and were made in Japan.  One of them has the original

                  <p>From sitting cows, we move to cows kneeling or lying down.  Although the brown creamer on the left is
                    unmarked, it is quite similar to the white one in the photo of four which is stamped for
                    T.G.Green, Ltd., Church Gresley (Swadlincote, Derbyshire), and Made in England.  Plus, we bought
                    it at the famous Bermondsey market in London, so it’s almost certainly English.  T.G.Green was
                    established in the 1790s, and is apparently most well known for what is called ‘Cornishware’;
                    poking around on the web, it would seem that at some point it became part of the Table Top
                    Company, and the Church Gresley plant has recently been closed.  The grey and white cow next to
                    the dark brown one is from Japan, although it bears a close resemblance to the German ones, like
                    the white one on the far right; that one is inscribed ‘1891’ in addition to ‘Germany’ (I believe,
                    both from the nature of the inscription and the shape of the head, that it’s by Gerold Porzellan
                    of Bavaria).  The small brown ones, 3rd from left and far right in the two photos, are also
                    inscribed Germany between the hooves on their lower right side; the one in the photo of six was
                    said to date from around 1910; the dark brown one appears to me to be much newer. For the rest –
                    the large brown cow with its feet together in front, 3rd from right in the photo of six, is
                    English; the others are from Japan.</p>

                    “Broadway” on its left flank.   The dark brown one with black horns, ears and hooves, however
                    bears the stamp of “Studio Szeiler”.   Joseph Szeiler appears to have been a quite successful and
                    popular potter, and there are a number of web sites about him and his work.  From
                    http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/szeiler/  we learn that he “was born in South West Hungary in
                    1924, the son of a Master Butcher. He attended High School for eight years and in 1944 obtained
                    his entry to the Budapest University. His ambition was to become a veterinary surgeon, and to
                    this end he studied his chosen course for two and a half hears. Sadly, the uncertain and
                    complicated situation of his country was such that he decided to give up his studies, and left
                    Budapest in 1947”.   He first went to Austria, then to England where after a few false starts he
                    ended up finding work in the potteries in Burslem, Staffordshire, where he learned the trade and
                    became determined to become a master potter himself.  Starting in 1951 he built up his trade,
                    mostly of animal figures (perhaps motivated by his earlier desire to be a vet), eventually owning
                    a factory on Moorland Road.  After his death in 1986 the property was sold off, and the current
                    owners, Moorland Pottery, also have made some cow creamers and teapots that are shown elsewhere
                    on these pages. </p>

                    which appears to have been made for some special occasion or group. The base reads in script: "Safe Harbour - Designed from an old platter on hand engraved copper attributed to Rogerd 1829. Produced in Royal Staffordshire Ceramics England".  Interestingly it came to me
                    from a German-Amish area in Indiana, and probably came over to the US with one of those families.  I have since seen this design on other cow creamer shapes.</p> </blockquote>

                    This cow creamer pattern is often advertised as ‘cute’. I find it rather obnoxious actually, but then I
                    guess my tastes differ. It frequently comes with sugar bowls and salt and pepper shakers.  Makes
                    it even worse! What I find most amazing about it however is the wide variety of molds, as well as
                    colorations, shapes, and materials (note that there’s even a metal one) in which it is made. 
                    I’ve  seen it attributed to a large number of potteries, and many places have used it as a souvenir.  The box shown here that says its name is Bossy isn’t
                    any help in identifying its origin – this version was made in Taiwan, but the box has  no other information.  Many of these little horrors come from Japan of course. From the number of
                    them for sale on eBay – there’s always a couple dozen or so  of them on offer - it remains unseemingly popular.</p>
                    <p>Ugh!  So why do I buy it or display it? Well, collections like this can’t be based just on
                    personal preference – we’re equal opportunity cow-ists.  I did of course check the web for ‘Bossy
                    Cow’; it turns out there are actually a couple of web sites that use that name, but they don’t
                    relate to this beast.  World Wide Words does however provide some information on the name ‘Bossy’
                    for a cow – it apparently derives either from the Latin bos (ox or cow) or West County dialect
                    where a buss or bussa is a young unweaned calf. I also learned that The California Aggies (UC
                    Davis) have a ‘Bossy Cow Cow’ cheer.  Amazing.</p>

                    mold that was taken from an original.  The yellow and brown on the right, like those in the next
                    few pictures, was apparently designed to look somewhat like the real Elsie and take advantage of
                    her popularity.  This one was a souvenir from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.</p>

			  <p>For the remainder of this page, I display a number of Native American interpretations, all from the
                   <strong> Acoma Pueblo </strong> potteries of New Mexico.  The Acoma Pueblo is some 80 miles west of Albuquerque and is the
                    oldest continuously inhabited community in North America.  From Wikipedia we learn that “Four villages make up Acoma Pueblo: Sky City (Old Acoma), Acomita, Anzac, and McCartys. The Acoma Pueblo tribe is a federally recognized tribal entity. The historical land of Acoma Pueblo totaled roughly 5,000,000 acres (2,000,000 ha). The community retains only 10% of this land, making up the Acoma Indian Reservation.  Acoma Pueblo is a National Historic Landmark… The English name Acoma was borrowed from Spanish Ácoma (1583) or Acóma (1598). The Spanish name was borrowed from the Acoma word ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é meaning 'person from Acoma Pueblo'. ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é itself is derived from ʔáák’u (singular, plural: ʔaak’u̓u̓m̓e̓e̓ʈʂʰa). The name does not have any meaning in the modern Acoma language. Some tribal authorities connect it to the similar word háák’u 'preparedness, place of preparedness' and suggest that this might be the origin of the name. The name does not mean 'sky city'.   Other tribal elders assert that it means 'place that always was' while outsiders say it means 'people of the white rock'.”</p>
					<p> Acoma is  renowned for its pottery tradition. There is a lovely web page with lots of information at   <a href="http://www.acomaskycity.org/home.html?pgid=1" >http://www.acomaskycity.org/home.html?pgid=1</a>  There we learn that "The pottery of Acoma is strongly recognized for fluted rims, thin walls and geometric design. Potters of the pueblo implement similar techniques found in the local region, from collecting of the clay material from limited sources, forming the vessel for specific use, decorating with patterns and design by hand, to firing the pot at high temperature...these pots were traditionally hand-coiled, with hand-mixed clay and custom slip... Traditional designs include rainbow bands, parrots, and deer; or a black and brown motif with geometric pattern and impressively accurate fine lines. Orange and black are traditional colors...  Hatching patterns symbolize rain, while lightning, thunder clouds and mountains are also represented.  The influences of the cycle of life, water and sky are frequently used." </p> </blockquote> </td>

                  <p>This little smiling lady is Josie, and she has an interesting story. The lady from whom I
                    acquired her visited Acoma in late 1989. A friend of hers from Albuquerque introduced her to
                    Howetruna (Tex Salvadore), Chief of the Acoma Tribe, and when she visited the pueblo she spent
                    the night at his home. After a dinner of what she claims is the hottest deer stew she ever ate,
                    they sat up and talked and laughed long into the night. He gifted her this little creamer when
                    she left the next day, and said that it was the last piece of pottery his wife Veronica had ever
                    made, and the only cow creamer. She had told him while she was making it that it would
                    belong to someone very special, and the next day she was killed in a car accident. He had kept
                    the pitcher for the next four or so years waiting to find that someone special, and decided that
                    it was her because of the joyful and healing time they had together. After many years she
                    was looking for someone to pass it on to who would give it a permanent home, and so it has now
                    become a treasured part of this collection.</p>
