        <p>Many of the ‘modern’ creamers (and teapots, and pitchers,  etc) have stickers or marks which identify their makers, and I’ve tried to  identify them in the appropriate theme section.   Here I’m featuring just a few factories or brands, selected either  because I have quite a number of their cows in my collection, or because their  brand names are quite well known, or just because I personally find them pretty  special.</p>
        <p>There are two makers or cow creamers that I like best of  all.  The first of these is <strong>Goebel</strong> of (West) Germany,  perhaps best known for their Hummel figurines (yes, I have some Hummels  --inherited from my Grandmother -- but they don’t pass muster for this  collection).  Goebel seems to have made  quite a number of cow creamers and pitchers over the years (they bear a number  of different Goebel marks, from the Crown through various bees), some  realistic, others fanciful.  I would hope  that some serious Goebel collector can perhaps tell me how many cow creamers  and pitchers they have actually produced – I’ve tried the web and a number of  books, but without success.</p>

              <td width="77%" scope="col"><p>From the number of these that come available on eBay, they seem  to be the most common of the Goebel cow creamers.  The smaller version of the standing creamer has  a matching sugar bowl, but I’ve never found one for the larger creamer.  This model has also been used fairly widely  for souvenirs.</p></td>

              <td><p>These Goebel caricatures of a cow with a large back opening  and outsized udder (must be uncomfortable) are also fairly common, and were popular  as a souvenir…at least at Niagara Falls.   They all bear the Large V bee, used by Goebel from 1950-1955. The two  with brown spots also say “Germany” which implies they were made for sale in  the US, which requires country of origin markings.  The matte white one has the Goebel mark on a  hoof along with “Foreign”. That term was initially used for German products  sold in the UK after WWI, but this one is too modern for that so I don’t know  the reason for the designation. Maybe again UK though, since there was unlikely  to be much love for German products there for quite some time after WWII.</p></td>

              <p>Many of the Goebel creamers have   apparently been copied by other manufacturers. The smaller of the brown and   white ones in the first picture has many close ‘relatives’, and I have a couple   of the outsized-udder ones that are unmarked and quite similar to the Goebels.    Here’s another example – the one on the left is marked for “Goebel, W.   Germany” and came   to me from an eBay seller in the UK.  I bought the other   two on a trip to <SPAN id="lw_1229226357_15">Germany</SPAN>; the middle one is marked “Made in   W. Germany”, and the   one on the right – that has some extra ceramic on the neck – is unmarked. The   ‘original’ has the horns and ears separated while they’re merged in the   copies. </p></td>

Following the end  of WWII, this area became part of the US Zone of Germany – as this interesting  stamp on one of the more popular Goebel cow creamers testifies. </p></td>

              <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Schafer and Vater </strong>is my other favorite brand.  Gustav  Schafer and Gunther Vater founded their factory in Volkstedt Rudolstadt, Thuringa, Germany  in 1890, to produce high quality porcelain. In 1896 they purchased the List  Porcelain Factory at Neuhaus, and by 1910 Sears Roebuck &amp; Company began to  import and distribute Schafer &amp; Vater pottery into the US. In 1913 Paul Schafer took over from his  father and, working alongside Gunther Vater, built up a successful workforce of  around 200 people, using 3 kilns. In 1918 the factory was destroyed by fire and  they set up a new factory to resume production.&nbsp; The firm closed in 1962, and it’s  believed that the East German government assumed control of the vacant factory  in 1972, and all records and molds were destroyed. Schafer &amp; Vater are  well-known for comical and figural items, as well as jugs, creamers, miniature  liquor bottles for distribution by pubs, special advertising runs for clients,  figurines, match strikers, hair holders, “naughties”, hat pin holders, and  planters. Their impressed mark is a crown above an 'R' in a star, although it  wasn’t always used and frequently is indistinct.&nbsp; A characteristic of  their pottery is the fine texture of the locally mined clay that was rich in  kaolin and yielded pottery with velvety texture and very fine grain.   There are a number of S&amp;V collectors  featured on the web.&nbsp; I have stayed strictly with their dressed-up animal  creamers, but I like their work so much that I have succumbed to a number of  their other animals in addition to cows, as you will see.</p></td>

This certainly  helps with the dating.</p></td>

I prevailed,  but at some cost! They’re great examples of the S&amp;V sense of humor,  combined with very high quality pottery.   Now that I have three of these, I’m naturally wondering how many more  variations there are.</p></td>

              <p>This pig came to me from Manchester England, and the seller  said he got it from a dealer in Scotland.   At first I was quite excited because it’s of thicker and heavier  porcelain than all the other S&amp;V animal creamers, and has a rim around the  back opening as well as an unglazed rim on a recessed, glazed bottom.&nbsp; It  does bear the S&amp;V mark (partial) as well as a mold number, so I thought for  sure it must be one of theirs, revealing a different manufacturing  technique.  But it turns out, <strong>NOT SO!</strong> Sometime later I saw what  looked like an S&amp;V creamer offered on eBay with a cautionary note to buyers  that it was a reproduction.  The seller  pointed to the <a href="http://www.keralouve.com/">www.keralouve.com</a> web  site, of the Mundial Company. of Belgium.   So I there and sure enough – among a lot of other reproductions of many  different makers, was this pig.  These  folks only sell to vendors, so apparently feel they can pass off their products  and let others take the hit for falsifying origin. As noted above, all the  S&amp;V molds had been destroyed by the East Germans. Turns out this pig is a  recast - the thickness comes from their having used an original to create a new  mold .  Coloration, glaze, etc. also  differ from the original. Seems I now have to be more careful when acquiring  S&amp;V (and other older) items, particularly because I’ve noticed these types  of reproductions showing up on eBay more frequently.  Whether the chap in Manchester or the person  he got it from in Scotland knew it was a reproduction I have no way of knowing  -  but having been fooled once (to the tune  of £62) I will now be more careful, and take advantage of eBay’s buyer protection  policy should I get ‘bit’ again.</p>              </td>

              <p>Here’s another pig monk that bears a faint S&amp;V mark –  very different from the interpretation shown above, and the only one of this  mold that I have ever seen.   I was, and  remain, a bit skeptical about this one’s provenance albeit the bisque and mark  match those on known S&amp;V creamers.  I  checked the <a href="http://www.keralouve.com/">www.keralouve.com</a> site mentioned above,  but it’s not there, so if this is indeed a reproduction, it’s someone  else’s.  At least it wasn’t very  expensive, so it was well worth taking the chance.  </p></td>

He sold the Horchow Collection to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neiman_Marcus" title="Neiman Marcus">Neiman Marcus</a> in 1988.” Horchow has produced  quite a numberv of successful Broadway plays, and is the author of three books.

He grew up in San Diego and attended San Diego State  College receiving first his BA and then his MA in sculpture with a master's  show featuring among other things, the Bank of America on the back of a  pig.&nbsp; (It was during the Vietnam War.)&nbsp; He married me, Diane Chase,  and taught art classes part-time at San    Diego State  and the various local junior colleges.&nbsp; We had two children, Carlson and  Alana, and I taught elementary school. In 1983, we were introduced to the  American Craft Council shows and Tom found a ready audience for his work in  galleries and stores across the country.&nbsp; While it forced him to be a  little more commercial than he would have liked, it served us well, enabling us  to work together and put the children through school. In 1995, we chose to let  the people who had worked for us, seven of them at the busiest, go on to other  things and we pared the line down so that Tom was not doing so much repetition  and more one-of-a-kind work.&nbsp; It is still exciting and he's always working  on something new.&nbsp; He still never talks about what he is making and it is  always a surprise when I see a completed work.&nbsp; It's fun.”  You can see more of Tom’s cow pieces on the  Teapots page. </p>                  </td>

They focused on whimsical kitchen items and giftware, and are probably best known for their ‘pixiware’. They were bought out by General Housewares Corporation in 1969, but the HH name was apparently retained until production ceased in 1990.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.collectics.com/education_pixieware.html">http://www.collectics.com/education_pixieware.html</a>.  Pixiware was so popular that other companies started to copy it.  One of these companies was Lipper &amp; Mann, who are responsible for the funny cow set on the right.  According to the web site for Lipper International – Lipper bought out Mann in 1963 and changed the name – they were organized in 1946 on 5th Ave, NY, as an importer of glass and ceramics from Czechoslovakia and other European companies.  They started importing from Japan in 1947, which is where these (and the teapot set shown in that section) came from.  Mr Lipper passed on in 2002 but the company is still going strong, now as a wholesaler of wooden items and, among other things,  ‘Lipperware’.                  </p></td>

               <p>The Lenox Corporation web site has a nice ‘about us’ section that tells a lot about its proud history.  It starts: “In 1889, founder Walter Scott Lenox had the confidence and passion to pursue his vision of creating "the finest American porcelain dinnerware" with a start-up company that operated for several years on a shoestring budget. In the early years, his persistence and determination led to the company's success. Demand for his unique and artistic American porcelain products steadily grew and, 125 years later, the Lenox brand continues to be the most trusted tabletop name in the U.S. market. Today, our bone china is still manufactured in the U.S., at our Kinston, North Carolina facility.”  While many potteries have changed hands or closed over the years, Lenox is not only a survivor but a gobbler with an apparently huge appetite. These days, The Lenox Corporation includes among its brands Dansk, Gorham, Reed & Barton, Kate Spade New York and The French Chefs as well as Lenox. </p></td>

              <p>Apparently being ‘one of the finest   …’ gets your stuff purchased and resold by <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_10">Eximious of London</SPAN>.  That was a new word to me, so   first I looked it up and found that my huge Webster’s unabridged says that yes   it is indeed obsolete, but that it means ‘select, choice, excellent’.  The blue   Eximions logo goes a bit further, claiming ‘Excellent, Distinguished,   Elegant’.  Dr Bill Long’s Spellers Diary gives a somewhat fuller explication:    “When the Puritans began to publish their voluminous sermons   and theological treatises in the <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_11">17th   century</SPAN>, they bequeathed to the <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_12">English language</SPAN> not only a peculiar   Scripture-centered piety that has been rediscovered by many in our day, but they   discovered (or invented) lots of words to capture the fullness and   transformative power of the Gospel that they   preached… one of their   words, <EM><em>eximious</em></EM>, [was] used by the   greats such as John Owen and John Flavel, and meaning   ‘excellent, distinguished, or eminent.’<strong> </strong>Granted, the OED says   that it was a common term in 17th century literature which assumed a rather   pedantic meaning in the 19th (see the discussion of <EM><em>esurient </em></EM>in a previous essay), but I was   impressed through some quick internet searches of the way it is used in   connection with the ‘<EM><em>eximious</em> </EM>way of the   Cross’or ’<EM><em>eximious</em> </EM>expression of   love’ by the Puritan preachers.”   <strong><strong> </strong></strong>See what you can   learn from the bottom of a cow? Incidentally, the <A href="http://www.eximious.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.eximious.com</A> web   site notes that “Josephine Louis, founder and Chairwoman,   discovered the charming and elegant shop called Eximious during the time she   lived in <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_15">England</SPAN> in the 1980's. Famous   for gifts and monogrammed accessories - the Belgravia shop so thoroughly   inspired Mrs. Louis that she decided to start a catalogue and shop in the   United   States. Twenty four years   later, Eximious of <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_16">London</SPAN> has   become synonymous with the understated good taste and elegance of British   traditions and is justly proud of a clientele in numerous countries…Eximious'   well-deserved reputation is the result of a tireless quest throughout <SPAN id="lw_1231031764_17">Europe</SPAN> and the world by Mrs. Louis   and her staff, who travel for months in pursuit of the select collection of   treasures which she is so delighted to share with you.”  </p></td>

              <td><p>These three are humorous ‘take-offs’ on the cow creamer by  Beswick, a famous maker of high quality figurines.  From <a href="http://www.myantiquemall.com/">www.myantiquemall.com</a>,  I learned that “J. Beswick (pronounced BESS-wik) started his Staffordshire  pottery around 1894 making dinnerware and such ornamental ceramics as the then  ubiquitous Staffordshire cats and dogs. Most were unmarked and are hard to tell  from their competitors’.”   In 1934  descendents John Ewart and Gilbert Beswick introduced high fired bone china  figurines of “unmatched quality and detail” first featuring animals in humorous  settings, and then under ceramicist Arthur Gredington they started using named  breed champions as models. Their champion horses, dogs, and cows were very  famous and popular (and expensive). In 1969, having run out of heirs to run the  firm, the family sold out to Royal Doulton. I’m sure that  there is a story to accompany these ‘creamers’; they are actually  ‘models’ or satires of creamers, and have no mouth holes. They were  designed by Graham Tongue, and were made from 1982-89, Model #2792.  The  one with the yellow flowers seems to be the most common, but as seen here there  are also blue and purple versions (and maybe more??).</p></td>

Be that as it may, I of course needed one of each pattern that they make…they’re   on page 3 of Modern Variations, along with a couple collector’s   versions.</p></td>

                “Kent”  cow creamers bearing the knot logo, like the ones on the right and center in  this photo, date from 1944-1962 (when the factory stopped making them) and were  produced from 19th century molds. The Museum of Pottery  and Art in Stoke on Trent  (home of the fabulous Keiller collection of Staffordshire cow creamers) has  reproduced some in various colors (with the knot logo) for sale exclusively at  their gift shop; the creamer with the green country scene on the left is one of  those.  William Kent initially  established his factory in Burselm in 1878, and produced ‘Old Staffordshire’  style pottery from even older molds.  The  early Kent  versions, as well as those that predate his operation or have been reproduced  more recently, are unmarked.  They come  in a wide range of colors and decorations, both on bases and free standing.  All however have lids. See Jim Hurford’s  website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/%7Ejim/">http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~jim/</a> for some examples of older ‘Kent’  type creamers in the Staffordshire theme. </p></td>

              <td><p><strong> To conclude this page, here is one last favorite European company.</strong></p><br>
                <p>This is Villeroy &  Boch’s “Happy Farm” cow, the only modern one that have made as far as I know. .  Wikipedia tells us that the company that because  V&B “began in the tiny Lorraine village of Audun le Tiche, where the iron master François Boch set up a pottery company with his three sons in 1748.  In 1766 Boch was licensed to build a ceramics kilnworks nearby at Septfontaines, Luxembourg, where it operated a porcelain factory. In 1785 Nicolas Villeroy became sole owner of the faience manufactory at Wallerfangen. In 1812 Jean-François Boch began construction of kilns at the nearby town of Mettlach, Saarland. In 1824 Boch commenced transfer printing on porcelain from engraved copper plates. On 14 April 1836, the Jean François Boch company merged with that of the competitor, Nicolas Villeroy, and became Villeroy & Boch, (V&B, also simply 'VB'). Since 1869, when Villeroy & Boch opened the first manufactory specializing in architectural tiles, the company has operated in three main areas, autonomous until 1982, tablewares, tiles for flooring and revetments, and fine plumbing fixtures…The company's Luxembourg factory was closed down in 2010. While the company is no longer run by a family member, under the present Group Chairman Frank Goering, there are various family members currently working in the company. Since 1990 the company… has been listed on the German stock market but the voting capital is still in the hands of the family descendants.” These days V&B is worldwide but has its broadest market in Germany.  For a detailed history of its founding and development over the past 250 plus years, go to www.villeroyboch-group.com/en/company/our-stories/history.html.  I have a four lovely  souvenir cow creamers made by V&B in Luxembourg, presumably in early 20c,  that are shown on the Advertising And Souvenirs page. </p>
